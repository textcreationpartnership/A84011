         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile I was thinking to whom I might dedicat this Book, in which is aſſerted the Authority and Non-uſurpation of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> I judged none more fit then him to whoſe patronage I might commit it, who hath moſt promoted the Liberty lately obtained, under the power and protection of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And thus, among many, I made choice of your Lordſhip. Albeit I look upon Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that which is inconſubſiſtent with juſt Freedom and Liberty; nevertheleſs, under what Power and Authority I am, be what it will, I am willing to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. And therefore I will humbly offer my judgment to your Lordſhip, in this caſe; which I hope will be uſeful to abate the ſeditiouſneſs of ſpirit, to which many (as is at leaſt pretended upon a conſcientious accompt) are bent.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs to diſtinguiſh between the caſe of Superiority and Inferiority. Now the Word of God will have the inferiour ſubject to the ſuperiour, without any reſiſtance, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience-ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. The higher can never be without the lower, the one neceſſarily pre-ſuppoſing the other. And therefore, that which is lower and inferiour, ought to be ſubject to the higher and ſuperiour. Hence it is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> &amp; his Apoſtles, ſubjected themſelves to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of tyrants, even to ſuch whoſe title and right depended meetly from the ſword. So then, put me under the <hi>Turk</hi>'s command, I ſhall not diſpute
<pb facs="tcp:114526:3"/>
his power. Shew me where <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any of his Apoſtles, diſpute the authority of any power they lived under. It is undeniable, they ſpoke and preached againſt all manner of ſin and vice, bearing faithful witneſs againſt it. And thus they witneſſed againſt the ſins of Princes, aſwel as of the People. Howſoever, there is a great difference between a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, and as a man. As a Magiſtrate he cannot fail, but either in tyranny, or in injuſtice, or elſe in bribery. As a man, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to perſonal infirmities as others ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I muſt confeſs, the Goſpel wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth abundantly againſt all theſe failings. But as I underſtand, the Goſpel doth not allow the inferiour to ſpeak directly, and by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication againſt the Magiſtrate, as he faileth in his office. I do not read where <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles charged any Ruler with tyranny, injuſtice, or bribery, in the diſcharge of his truſt. Sure I am, there were many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judge in their time. I made, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> called <hi>Herod,</hi> a Fox: and <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Nero,</hi> a Lion But the Law could not conclude from hence, that any thing was ſpoken againſt them as Magiſtrates: Becauſe as men, they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as Foxes and cruel as Lion. And thus the Law could make no other, but their ſpeaking againſt perſonal taults in the Magiſtrate. And I judge it not unlawful, upon ſome ſerious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, (though not by all perſons and at all occaſions) to ſpeak againſt the perſonal ſins of the Magiſtrate in a down-right way, as did the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt to <hi>Herod.</hi> If this will not ſatisfie, then obſerve that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not at that time ſubject to <hi>Herod,</hi> but to <hi>Pilate.</hi> And may not I ſpeak againſt any tyrannous Magiſtrate, to whoſe Law &amp; Government I am not ſubjected? Yea, againſt the great <hi>Turk,</hi> though I might not being under his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for that of <hi>Paul.</hi> it is not clear what he meaneth by the Lion. Only this much he is pleaſed to be a little free with his dear friend, <hi>Timothy.</hi> And truly, I may uſe ſo much freedom with my dear friend, as with mine own heart. But what is all this for the ſubject to call the Magiſtrate to his face, A tyrannous and partial Judge granting he be ſo? Shall I therefore, both in private and publick ſpeak what I will (making an ordinary trade of it) againſt his unfaithfulneſs in managing his office? Scripture doth not allow me to think any thing againſt him in my Bed-chamber, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>

And we ſee how that <hi>Paul</hi> in all his arraignments, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his conſtant plea that in his preaching the Goſpel he ſpake nothing whether againſt the Magiſtrate, or the Law of the Nation; whereupon
<pb facs="tcp:114526:3"/>
many times he eſcaped. Yea, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt doth not diſpute the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of the <hi>Romon Souldiers,</hi> but, waving State-matters, exhorteth them to their duty, as is pertinent to a Goſpel-Preacher. Notwithſtanding, I would have it ſeriouſly minded, that I only ſpeak of the duty of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour toward the ſuperiour: ſo that whatſoever is really and properly inferiour, ought, without diſputing the matter, give due obedience to the ſuperiour not reſiſting the higher power. Now ſay I, every individual ſubject <hi>ſeorſim,</hi> or any inconſiderable number thereof, is inferiour to the Magiſtrate. And therefore ought not to reſiſt his power. I admire how any perſon or perſons, who are not in a capacity, yea, not ſo much as in a probability of withſtanding the Maſtiſtrat's power, dare adventure to do ſo, (unleſs miraculouſly and extraordinarily aſſiſted as were the Prophets of old) even though, not only to them but alſo <hi>revera</hi> his power is tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and his commands unjuſt. Will any rational man ſay, I ought to reſiſt an hundred high-way Robbers, and not give them that which they ſeek, though unjuſtly? If I did ſo, whatſoever evill befell me in reſiſting, I ſhould be acceſſory to it my ſelf as none in reaſon can deny.</p>
            <p>But if it be asked, <hi>Whether or not ought the People to reſiſt the Magiſtrate?</hi> Say I, The lawfulneſs, or unlawfulneſs of their reſiſting, only dependeth from the nature of the quarrel. It is clear to me (as is fully evinced in the following Treatiſe) not only the whole Power, but alſo any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable power of the People may v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry juſtly reſiſt the Magiſtrate, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and promoting their own juſt Liberty and freedom: for as the whole Power of the People is ſuperiour, ſo any conſiderable part thereof is not inferiour to the Magiſtrate's power. And thus my judgment lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me no other wales to reſiſt a tyrannous Magiſtrate, but as I am added by Providence to that Body, whoſe Quarrel is not only juſt, but alſo whoſe Power is either ſuperiour to the Magiſtrate's Power, or at leaſt ſo far equal to it as that it is in a capacity of reſiſting it Now, if I either miſtake the Quarrel, or the conſiderable capacity of reſiſting, 'tis my raſhneſs to engage againſt the Ruler, and juſt with God to puniſh my ſeditiouſneſs, though my engaging be upon zealous and conſcientious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts. Let a very <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter</hi> be rebuked, though in zeal he ſmile <hi>Malchus,</hi> not being able to maintain his act of Reſiſtance. As to example, had I a year or two ſince ſpoken or acted againſt the late Parliament, me thinks I had not only done unwiſely (unleſs, as I ſaid before, I had been raiſed up extraordinarily, as were the Prophets of old, in ſpeaking and acting againſt the tyranny of the Magiſtrate) but alſo ſeditiouſly. But now it is high time for me, or any wel-wiſher of the People's Liberty, to ſpeak and act, in our ſeveral employments and vocations, againſt the late Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. As it is time to ſail when tide and wind make, and no ſooner; ſo it is time to engage, and no ſooner, for Freedom and Liberty, when either the People's willingneſs, or a ſtanding Power call for it. Then let every
<pb facs="tcp:114526:4"/>
man, according to his ability, (whoſe ambition is to promote juſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Liberty) improve his time, letting no occaſion ſlip, but ſtrike the iron while it is yet hot. Sooner, it is folly; and latter, it is but a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the air. And thus let every cordial wel-wiſher of Freedom, walk wiſely, neither going a ſtep before, nor a ſtep behind the willingneſs and power of the People, in promoting the foreſaid Intereſt. The Quarrel of juſt Freedom not arightly timed, is loſt labour, and an untimely birth. This poſſibly will be called Policy rather then Piety. But it matters not if this Policy be true Divinity, as is already ſhewed to be. He is worthy of all commendation, who neither reſiſteth the Ruler's ſuperiority, nor thwarteth, but promoteth the People's Liberty. Thus is he neither rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious nor malignant, but obedient to his ſuperiour during his Command, and faithful to the Intereſt of the People. Let me obey the Tyrant ſo long as he commandeth, but ſide with the People when they oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>Beſide what I have ſpoken, (if I may be called to counſel) I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offer ſome of my earneſt wiſhes unto your Lordſhip. O that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained maintenance for upholding Prieſts, Chaplains, and Maſters in Univerſities, were at an end! Oh, that all who are able, and willing, to preach the Goſpel, might be encouraged with all due freedom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection therein, upon all occaſions, and in all convenient places, without moleſtation, whether in private, or in places of publick meeting! All which ſhall come to paſſe, when that is accompliſhed which is foretold, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>As for annual Repreſentatives, the levelling of the Law, ſubjecting all to it without exception; the diſpoſing ſo of all Rents, Revenues, Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Sequeſtrations, and ſuch like, as that competences may be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of them for all that want, they be things too high for me. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take liberty to ſpeak in order to ſuch things as immediatly relate to the Freedom of Saints, and the Fall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> As to Religion's Intereſt, every wel-wiſher of <hi>Zion</hi> may uſe freedom. Howſoever I judge it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for me to ſpeak any thing of theſe laſt particulars, ſeeing (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) they are already taken into conſideration by all theſe who mind the true and juſt Intereſt of the People. Nay, but (my Lord) J cannot forget, how that one day after another J hear large diſcourſe of <hi>Levelling.</hi> But though the moſt part be for it, excepting the Rich, (as it was of old in the dayes of <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi>) J cannot well learn what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereby. Only J do find in it, theſe two things which be either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant or defective, as to the nature of right Levelling. Firſt, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand no more, but the levelling of the Law. Secondly, others over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn propriety ſo much, as that they intend no more uſe of the Creation, but here to day, and yonder to morrow. J ſhall not diſpute this caſe at preſent, but only adde ſome few words to what is ſpoken in this matter. As J underſtand, people ſo much the more cheerfully ought to engage to promote their juſt Civil Freedom and Liberty, how much the more the
<pb facs="tcp:114526:4"/>
fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the intereſt of <hi>Zion</hi> are concerned therein. 'Tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to me, to engage for the one, the other not being linked therewith; though ſelf-defence be lawful upon all accompts. Howſoever the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of the Lamb is that which J heed moſt. But if your Lordſhip, and others in power, will allow me in this caſe, to remonſtrate to the world, the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh, Athenian, Lacedemonian, Roman,</hi> and of other ancient and notable Commonwealths, J ſhall be moſt willing to do ſo at command. And J ſhall endeavour to publiſh nothing, but what is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures, the practice of the chiefeſt Commonwealths, the judgment, yea and practice of the chiefeſt Stateſ-men, Philoſophers, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Hiſtorians. O! but all of us will be prevented in theſe things, by the ſudden approach of the Ancient of dayes, who being come, will level ſpirits, powers, and eſtates. Till then there will be no more but the beginnings of Liberty, the earneſt of what ſhall be when the Lord alone ſhall be exalted, ſtaining the pride of all Glory, and bringing into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt all the Honourable of the Earth. Yea, as I conceive, it is impoſſible a ſolid and entire Freedom can be eſtabliſhed, till His approach: for then He ſhal judge among the Nations, becoming our Lord, our King and Law-giver, the Law going out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the Word of the Lord from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I reſt ſatisfied in the expectation thereof, not exerciſing my ſelf in great matters, nor in things too high for me. When he cometh, croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked things ſhall be made ſtraight, and mountains ſhall be made valleys. The Lord will haſten it in his time.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, J would offer my judgment to your Lordſhip, concerning the Power of the People, in chooſing Rulers. J ſhall only hint at this in a word. To me it is clear, that as Nature in the ſtate of fallen-man (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe all ſhould go to ruin) cannot be without Government, even though all men by Nature be free-born; ſo neither are all capable of governing, nor of chooſing to govern. The Scripture is clear in this, that only ſuch ought to govern, who are men <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>hating Covetouſneſs, Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Job</hi> 34.17, 29, 30. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 20.16, 17. And thus, uppon a Scripture-accompt, according to the primitive pattern of Judges in the choiceſt of Commonwealths, there be theſe four qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations neceſſarily required in thoſe that govern, 1. ability, 2. fearing of God, 3. truth, 4. hatred of Covetouſneſs. Whence, according to the primitive and Scripture-mould of Judges, all men are uncapable of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, but ſuch who be ſo and ſo qualified. Now the queſtion is, <hi>Who ſhall chooſe ſuch who are endowed with theſe qualifications?</hi> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this J premiſe, this diſtinction. As the Legiſlative power <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> is in the People, ſo by Nature they ought to chooſe their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Rulers. But Nature being contaminated, all men upon that accompt are not fit to make choice of their Rulers. For all men are either godly, or ungodly. Now, the major part of the People, being ungodly, will, and do chooſe men like themſelves, as experience teacheth, unleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:114526:5"/>
upon ſome ſelfiſh accompt they happen now and then, here and there, to chooſe ſome godly perſon or perſons. But the Scripture doth not allow any to rule but the Righteous. And therefore, according to the Word of God, and the dictates of pure Nature godly men, (who are known to be ſuch by their fruits) ſhould be ſearched thorowout all the Tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and appointed Rulers. So did <hi>Moſes.</hi> And our <hi>Moſeſes</hi> ought to do ſo too; to which the People in reaſon will be forced to condeſcend, and the rather, when they ſee judgment and righteouſneſs abounding, while the righteous govern. And which is more, in all heatheniſh ancient Commonwealths, in which the Rulers were choſen by the People, the whole multitude therein followed the counſel of ſome few wiſe-men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Otherwiſe, the whole matter among them ſhould have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into confuſion. And is it not known by experience, how that ſome one faction or other doth ſway in all elections? though the free choice of the People be pretended? Now the generality of the People are ſwayed, rather by the diſaffected, then wel-affected party, in al free choice til they be conſtrained to do otherwiſe. Which is a clear demonſtration that they cannot improve their own Intereſt, but are apt to give it up into the hands of ſtrange Lords, and cruel Task-maſters. And therefore all our wiſe and godly <hi>Moſeſes,</hi> whom the Lord hath impower'd, ought to aſſay all means poſſible, to find out among all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, and hating Covetouſneſs, that they may bear burden with them in the management of affairs. And ſuch of them as be poor there is enough in the world to make them rich. But I do not expect the full accompliſhment of ſuch things, till the Ancient of dayes be come: for I ſee <hi>under the ſun the place of judgment, [that] wickedneſs</hi> is <hi>there; and the place of righteouſneſs, [that] iniquity</hi> is <hi>there. I</hi> ſay <hi>in mine heart, God ſhall judge the righteous, and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpoſe, and for every work. Eccleſ.</hi> 3.16, 17.

Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall contribute my mite to the treaſury, in proſecuting theſe following Poſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114526:6"/>Poſit. <hi>1. The Law in its ſubſtantials needeth no reformation, being grounded upon the principles of pure Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall glance a little at the diſcovery of the general and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principles of the Law. In general it conſiſteth of a direct and indirect part. The direct part of the Law is, <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata.</hi> The indirect is, <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; improbata.</hi> The direct principles thereof reſolve upon <hi>Allegation &amp; Probation,</hi> or upon <hi>Claim</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction. Claim</hi> is either in order to Movables, or Immovables. In order to immovables, the grounds thereof be <hi>heirſhip, diſpoſition, donation,</hi> and <hi>conqueſt.</hi> Heirſhip is, either of Line, or of Conqueſt. Of Line, <hi>ſecundum deſcenſum proprium. v. g.</hi> as is between father and ſon. And <hi>ſecundum deſcenſum accidentalem. v. g.</hi> as is between the elder, and younger brother. Of conqueſt, <hi>ne ultra unum gradum aſcendat. v. g.</hi> Conqueſt being disponed to the third ſon, cannot fall to the firſt. In order to which, the Law doth ſay well, <hi>Primogenito Primoginitura, &amp; caeteris Proportio: Juſtitia enim fit, ſecundum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionem.</hi> Dispoſition is, either mutual by way of contract, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal by way of aſſignation. But ſaith the Law, <hi>Ne ulla ſit diſpoſitio in fraudem creditorum.</hi> Donation is either abſolute, or conditional. In order to which, ſaith the Law, <hi>Volenti non fit, injuria.</hi> Conqueſt is, that which is purchaſed by the proper induſtry of the Owner, not being derived from any Predeceſſour. But, <hi>Quod Propria virtute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur, Propria ac libera voluntate diſponitur.</hi> As for the <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Claim, whether in order to Immovables, or Movables, it muſt be by Evidences, either of Writ, Witneſſes, or Confeſſion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is, either formal, or virtual. Virtual, <hi>aut per ſilentium, aut per abſentiam. Qui tacet, conſentire videtur. Non dormientibus, ſed vigilantibus ſunt jura.</hi> All which principles be very conſonant to Nature and ſound Reaſon, as is evident from the very tenor of them. To which all Law-principles, in point of ſuit, may be reduced, as is known to all skilful Lawyers.</p>
            <p>Poſit. <hi>2. Intail is a corrupt title of Claim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it hath no ground, either in Nature, or in Reaſon, but only in the circuit of a prodigal humour, for perpetuating a Name, which is but graſſe, and the glory thereof, as the flower that fadeth. Thus the perpetuating of the Line in the perſon of the eldeſt ſon, by vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing the whole ſubſtance on him, is no leſſe unjuſt then prodigal.</p>
            <p>Poſit. 3. Jure divino, <hi>upon the accompt of Divine Right, all Pleas
<pb facs="tcp:114526:6"/>
ought to be compoſed according to Conſcience and Reaſon, without all reſpect to any Platform of humane Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it was in the Primitive Inſtitution of the <hi>Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> (1) Special care was had to eſtabliſh ſuch Judges in it, as were men of Conſcience and Religion, <hi>Exod. 18.22, 25. Deut. 1.13, 15.</hi> Who were to judge the People, as did <hi>Moſes,</hi> making them know the Statutes of GOD, and his Laws, in judging Pleas between one and another, <hi>Ex. 18.16.</hi> (2) Becauſe as they were to judge no other Judgment but what was GOD's, <hi>Deut. 1.17.</hi> ſo they were to judge only for the Lord, <hi>2 Chron. 19.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſit. <hi>4. The Rigour of the Law is great injuſtice, although the Proceſs be</hi> ſecundum allegata, &amp; probata.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Nimium jus nimia injuria.</hi> I might inſtance a hundred caſes, in which the peremptorineſs of the Law is either too intenſe, or too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe.</p>
            <p>Poſit. <hi>5. Though the Law were never ſo juſt in it ſelf, it can never be juſtly executed, a Platform being obſerved, men not being left to their own freedom in judging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe a Platform can never be pleaded without Interpreters. Who, I pray, ſhall interpret? Not the Judges: for they cannot both judge, and plead. <hi>Hoc opus, hic labor eſt.</hi> Not the ignorant Purſuers, and Defenders: for <hi>ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> far leſs <hi>intellectio.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it only remaineth, that skilful Lawyers be employed. And then be ſure, of heavie burdens which they themſelves will not touch with one of their fingers. And thus a Platform's abrogation is the Law's reformation. Otherwiſe it is but <hi>verberatio aëris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſit. <hi>6. To day, the only beſt way of eaſing the People of their burdens in point of Suit, is, To remit all Pleas to the Arbitration of Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of this doth appear thus: All determination of Pleas of neceſſity is either upon a judicial, or (as I may ſo ſay) arbitral accompt. If upon a judicial accompt, then either according to the dictates of Conſcience and pure Reaſon, or the principles of a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. The former cannot be to day. Oh! how ſelfiſh are the beſt of men at this time? Though there be both godly and able men to day, yet cannot all places of truſt be filled with ſuch as anſwer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture qualifications of Rulers. Not til the time, <hi>Our Officers be, peace, and Exactors, righteouſneſs, the Judges being reſtored, as at the firſt,
<pb facs="tcp:114526:7"/>
and Counſellours as at the beginning.</hi> And as the former is impoſſible, ſo the other is hurtful: for as Judges qualified, as ſaid is, are rare, and many of them to fil al places of truſt cannot be found, ſo, a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form being eſtabliſhed, ſwarms of Lawyers, the main face-grinders, do abound. It therefore remaineth that Pleas be determined by way of Arbitration among friends. And then be ſure (not one of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred otherwaies) of little expence, great moderation, and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. Becauſe of the untowardneſs of People, I muſt needs adde ſome Cautions.</p>
            <p>Caut. <hi>1. The Purſuer refuſing without all reaſon, friendly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound by way of Arbitration, it will do well, if by an Act be forfeited,</hi> toties quoties, <hi>ſo much of his ſuit as may daunt him;</hi> viz. <hi>either one half, or a third part thereof, as may be judged convenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Caut. <hi>2. The Defender, upon no good grounds, refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound by way of friendly Arbitration, it will do well, if an Act bind him</hi> toties quoties, <hi>to forfeit an half, or a third part, more and above what is ſued of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Caut. <hi>3. It will do well, if ſome of the godlieſt and ableſt men be appointed and authorized to that end, to attend a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Pleas, which either cannot, or ſtubborn perſons refuſe to, be compoſed by way of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all due execution paſſing upon their Determination, whether as to the deciding of the Plea, or fining of the ſtubborn and refractory perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, as I conceive, do ſtand with Reaſon: for as the end of War is Peace, ſo the end of Law is Arbitration. Were all men beaten with the Law abroad, be ſure they would friendly agree at home. And many are forced to do ſo, when they have ſpent their time, wits, and eſtates upon it. So old Clients can, though wantons be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant thereof.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not multiply words on this ſubject at preſent, but willingly reſt ſatisfied with what is spoken already, though I might enlarge my ſelf theron, (to which I ſhall be moſt ready, whenſoever called thereto) being nothing but the abridgment of my thoughts in the matter; and hoping the poor man's counſel may deliver the City, ſuppoſing theſe words to be spoken in ſeaſon, the exigent of time calling for the like. I have no more to adde at preſent, but that I am</p>

            <p>THough my broken speech can adde nothing to the worth of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; yet I judge it my duty to utter ſome few words concerning it. I know, Truth in all ages hath had many enemies ſome men asking what it is, and ſome contradicting and appoſing. And ſurely that truth which croſſeth most the vanity, glory, and pride of this world, is moſt oppoſed by the men of this world, in whom the Prince of the power of the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> worketh. Yea, and any truth which in former ages hath not appeared unto the ſons of light, but hath been under a cloud, (the Sun of Righteouſneſs, in whoſe ſight Saints ſee light, being pleaſed not to make the cloud flee away) is ſeen, and ſcarce clearly ſeen, but by few, who are of the day, and not of the night. Hence is it that many who are light even oppoſe ſuch a truth. No wonder then though the truth ſpoken of here be ſo much oppoſed, ſeing it not only croſſeth the vanity of a vain-glorious age, but alſo hath been ſo long over-clouded. Howſoever it is very neceſſary to be known. Doubteſt thou whether it be lawful for thee to ſubmit to the preſent Government, the Power of the King being in thy apprehenſion abſolute without the bounds of Law; or the Kingly Government being the choiceſt and best. (and ſo not be altered) far better then a Commonwealth; or it being unlawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist the King and decline his Authority? Thou ſhalt find theſe things fully and largely cleared from arguments of all ſorts. To the Law, and to the Teſtimony of the Spirit of Truth, that compleat rule, they are brought. In the balance of Reaſon they are weighed. But if that ſhall not ſuffice thee who eyeſt much the examples of Politick Governments, and ſayings of men. Theſe arguments alſo are to be found here. You ſhall find that even certain of your Poets, Kings, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Hiſtorians, Orators, Philoſophers have ſaid ſo, as ſaith this Treatiſe. And that this Government is neither new-found out, nor uſurped, nor bad and dangerous; but by example of the firſt and beſt, the oldeſt, ſweeteſt, and moſt to be deſired, and by lawful practiſes of old, far from uſurpation. But if thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt that thou art engaged by the League and Covenant to ſtand for Monarchy; and ſo canſt not take a contrary Engagement. That caſe alſo is anſwered and cleared here. I counſel thee who doubtest, to ſearch whether the things which are laid down in the Treatiſe as truths, be ſo or not. That is Nobility indeed. O! if the ſons of men could learn to be <hi>Berean</hi>-like, more noble then thoſe of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica.</hi> Shut not thine eyes, ſtop not thine ears at the ſeeing and hearing of things of ſuch uſe and concernment.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly (courteous Reader) thou art fully perſwaded in thy mind of the truths ſpoken-of in this Book; and therefore apprehendeſt it to be uſeleſs, or born out of due time. Well, but art tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt thou engage thy life, eſtate, name, or pains one way or other in defence of that truth which here by arguments is defended, thou ſhalt do well
<pb facs="tcp:114526:8"/>
to inform thy ſelf well, and to ſtrengthen thy ſelf with good and ſound grounds, that with the better and cleaner conſcience, or greater courage thou mayeſt go on thy way? Moreover, if the Book had come forth when firſt it was written, thou couldſt not but have ſaid, it had been born in the due time. But hitherto it hath been hindered. Yet I ſuppoſe it is born in a due time, if we look upon the greateſt part of men. And if the ſpirits of men, chiefly of ſuch as know not this truth, were ſo framed as in moderation, impartiality, and ſimplicity to read the Treatiſe, they ſhould rejoyce at the birth thereof, and ſay it is very ſeaſonable: Yea, and find more perhaps in it then in ethers of that ſame nature. They would ſee the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of theſe truths diſcomfited and overthrown by their own weapons in which they ſo much glory; even by Reaſon, the teſtimonies of men, and that of all ſtations and conditions; and example of the moſt refined Policies and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And what obſcurity or obſtruſneſs is in the Book, it is becauſe of ſuch boaſters; whoſe mouthes the Author judged expedient to ſtop with arguments of that kind; and ſo to beat them from that place in which they thought their ſtrength did lie.</p>
            <p>I have no more to adde, but do again wiſh that without prejudice, malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, hatred, ſelfiſhneſs, in moderation and ſobriety, thou wouldſt peruſe the Treatiſe: and I dare ſay thou ſhouldſt receive more good thereby then poſſibly thou in the leaſt expecteſt. And for thine eaſe I have written the heads of it, as ſo many Aſſertions, or Concluſions. I leave thee, and it, to the diſpoſal of Him who ruleth all things in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth, whoſe Kingdom and Dominion are everlasting, in whoſe hand the hearts of the moſt mighty are, as the rivers of water; and He turneth them whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will.

               <p>ASSERT. I. <hi>The power of the King, as it commandeth juſt and lawful things, is abſolute, and in ſuch a notion cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contraveened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is made good, <hi>firſtly,</hi> from that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,—<hi>for he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him. Where the word of a King [is, there is] power, and who may ſay unto him, what doſt thou? Eccl.</hi> 8. Theſe words by Writers are diverſly expounded. (1.) Some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them concerning the abſolutenes of the Kings power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in things lawfull or unlawfull, good or bad. And in this we find none more willing then <hi>Salmaſius</hi> the Humaniſt, <hi>Defenſ. Reg. cap.</hi> 2. (2.) Others again who are no friends to abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Monarchy, do interpret the words, not <hi>de jure,</hi> but <hi>de facto Regis, i.e.</hi> they opinionat, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not ſpeak here of the power of Kings, which according to Law and Reaſon doth belong to them, but concerning the abſolute way of governing, which one way or other, is conferred upon Kings, whether by uſurpation or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or by a voluntary and free ſubjection of the people to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114526:10"/>
and arbitrary power in the Kingly Perſon. Yet (3.) I do chooſe a way diſtinct from either of theſe. And I expound the words concerning an abſolute power in the King, in things lawfull and honeſt. This I make good from the Contexts. 1. The Preacher ſaith, <hi>I [counſell thee] to keep the Kings commandment, and that in regard of the oath of GOD.</hi> Now, what power the Holy Ghoſt here giveth to Kings, is ſuch a power, whoſe ordinances he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to obey, and that under an obligation, being tyed to obey it by a lawfull oath, the oath of GOD. But we cannot obey the unjuſt Acts and Ordinances of an arbitrary and illimited power. Unleſs you will ſay, that it is lawfull for us to ſin againſt the LORD, and to do the will of man rather then the will of GOD, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which is ſpoken, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. and 5. Yea, as afterward is ſhewed, arbitrary Monarchy inveſted with a boundleſſe power, to do both good &amp; evill, is ſinful and unlawfull. And therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tye our ſelves by the oath of GOD to maintain it. Sure we are, we can not lawfully ſwear, to maintain and obey a ſinfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull power. Unleſſe you may alſo ſay, that we may lawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves by oath and Covenant, to maintain and obey the ordinance of Satan. 2. He ſpeaketh of ſuch a power which is not for maintaining vice, and allowing that which is evill, but for corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and puniſhing of evill-doers. <hi>Be not haſtie to go out of his ſight,</hi> (to do knaves who hate the light) <hi>ſtand not in an evil thing:</hi> Why? <hi>for he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him, &amp;c.</hi> Would the Holy Ghoſt ſay, ye muſt not dare to do evill, and with draw your ſelves prepoſterouſly from the Kings preſence; for he hath a power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, that cannot be contraveened in executing juſtice on malefactors. And therefore if ye tranſgreſſe, be ſure the King will puniſh you. So then this manifeſtly holdeth out to us, that the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh in this place, of ſuch a power in Kings, which exerciſeth good, and performeth that which according to the Law of GOD, is incumbent to the Kingly power to do. But ſure I am, illimited Monarchy, whoſe power is alſo to do evill, can ſpare the malefactour, and puniſh the righteous. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of a Kingly power, that produceth contrary effects. 3. The Holy Ghoſt ſubjoyneth, <hi>Whoſe keepeth the commandment, ſhal feel no evil thing.</hi> Then, this muſt be a juſt and lawfull commandment; otherwiſe obedience to it would bring forth death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. But ſure we are, this cannot be ſpoken concerning a boundleſſe and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114526:11"/>
Regall power: for as <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaketh of the Regall power, ſo he ſpeaketh of the effects thereof, and of our obedience thereto. And as we find, he ſpeaketh onely of good effects; ſo he onely ſpeaketh of an obedience and ſubjection thereto, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the oath of GOD, and in conſcience we are tyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. But as we cannot lawfully give up our oath of Allegiance to boundleſs and arbitrary Regall power, ſo there is a vaſt diſ-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between it and the effects of that power which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of here. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of a power which only produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth good effects. But arbitrary Monarchy is in a capacity of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing both good and bad effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> we eſtabliſh the point from reaſon it ſelf; the Kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it produceth good effects, not onely in it ſelf is the Ordinance of GOD, but alſo it executeth the purpoſe of GOD both on good and bad. But as the Ordinance of GOD cannot be contraveened; ſo it is laid on us as a neceſſary duty, to ſubject our ſelves for conſcience ſake to him who executeth the purpoſe of GOD, according to the preſcript of GOD'S wil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. So then, in ſuch caſes as GOD can not be contraveened, no more can the Kingly power be withſtood, but what it enacteth according to equity &amp; reaſon, ſhould abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be obeyed. In this ſenſe the Holy Ghoſt commandeth obedience and ſubjection, not onely to Kings, but alſo to all other Rulers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Per.</hi> 2.

Who then dare adventure in ſuch reſpects any way to contraveen the Kingly power, and to decline his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? for ſo, there is a divine ſentence in his lips, his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in judgment, his Throne is eſtabliſhed by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, righteous lips are his delight, and he loveth him that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth right, his wrath is as meſſengers of death, but in the light of his countenance is life, and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. In ſuch caſes his wrath is as the roaring of a Lion, but his favour is as dew upon the graſſe; he ſitteth in the Throne of judgment, ſcattering away all evill with his eyes, ſcattering the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114526:11"/>
wicked, and bringing the wheel over them: So mercy and truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, and his Throne is upholden by mercy; Yea, his fear is as the roaring of a Lyon, ſo that he who provoketh him to anger, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt his own ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19, and 20. Upon theſe grounds, and in theſe reſpects <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorteth us, to honour the King, <hi>Proverb.</hi> 24. and not to ſtrike: Princes for equity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. Therefore the Kingly power, as it is in it ſelf, and as it executeth the purpoſe of the juſt LORD of Heaven and Earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the LORD'S good will and pleaſure, neither his power, nor the juſt Acts thereof, can be any more contraveened, then the power of GOD, and that which he commandeth to be performed: for ſo the King's power is GOD'S power, and what he doth is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divine authority. And in theſe notions we hold the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power to be abſolute: for ſo, as his power in ſuch reſpects can not be contraveened, in like manner he may lawfully execute every thing that is good and expedient, with a full and vaſt power, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law and reaſon. So the power of the King of kings is vaſt and abſolute, not becauſe he may do both juſtly and unjuſtly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleaſure, but becauſe he may do every thing that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his eyes, according to juſtice.</p>

very quick and noble gloſſe. But for my ſelf, as I judge their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be nothing ſuch, ſo I am indifferent, whether it be ſo, or not. No queſtion, there be many who do plead for abſolute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Monarchy, beſide the Nation of Royalliſts. And thoſe, to whoſe temper abſolute Monarchy doth moſt reliſh, we find, to be attended with theſe qualifications. (1) They are meerly heroick and ambitious. So were the Giants before the Flood, <hi>Gen. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſ. Antiq. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Nimrod</hi> after the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. <hi>Bern. Antiq. l.</hi> 4. and all the reſt of the great Heroes, <hi>Ariſt. pol.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. (2) They are meerly tyrannous and cruel. So we find that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had an arbitrary power over the People of <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 1 and 5. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad-nezzar</hi> had the like power over his Kingdoms, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and 3. By vertue of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> abſolute power, <hi>Haman</hi> was licenced to exerciſe tyranny on the People of the <hi>Jews, Eſt.</hi> 3. We might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many examples to this purpoſe: But the point is moſt clear in it ſelf: for thoſe who are of a tyrannous diſpoſition can endure no Law, but their will: Otherwiſe, they could never get their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny exerciſed. (3) Thoſe whom we find chief pleaders for abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy, are either concerned therein themſelves, as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander M.</hi> and <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> and ſuch like; or elſe Flatterers and Court-Paraſites, as <hi>Lyricus Rom. Virgil,</hi> and ſuch like. And of this ſort we find none more violent in this matter, than <hi>Dr. Fern, Hugo Grotius, Arniſaeus, Spalato, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe foot-ſteps, with his ful-ſpeed <hi>Salmaſius</hi> doth trace. But although men by way of flattery and by-reſpect, may act and plead for arbitrary Monarchy; yet let me tell you, I do not imagin, but they may act and plead for it through ſimple error and deluſion. And ſo I conclude, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, Xiphilin, Saluſt,</hi> and the foreſaid Lawyers do much run this way, though they be more moderate in the matter then the reſt. And, as afterward is ſhewed, we find the <hi>Talmudick</hi> and <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binick Writers</hi> this way ſomewhat inclining to the lawleſs and arbitrary power of abſolute Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Aſſert. 2. <hi>The King hath not a power above Law, and a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, to diſpoſe upon things according to his pleaſure, whether with, or againſt Law and Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſtly,</hi> Such an arbitrary and vaſt power is repugnant to the firſt Inſtitution and Scripture-mould of Kings. According to the Holy Ghoſt's way of moulding the King, he is thus qualified. (1) He
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114526:12"/>
is an Elective King, choſen by the People, in ſubordination to God. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wayes ſet [him] King over thee, whom the LORD thy God ſhall chooſe—Deut.</hi> 17. (2) A Brother-King. and not a ſtranger-King. <hi>[One] from amongst thy Brethren ſhalt thou ſet King over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee, who is not thy Brother. Ibid.</hi> (3) He muſt not tyrannize over the People, by Leavying Forces, and by ſtrength of hand, drawing them into <hi>Egyptian ſlavery.—He ſhall not multiply horſes to himſelf, nor cauſe the People to return to</hi> Egypt, <hi>to the end that he ſhould multiply horſes: foraſmuch as the LORD hath ſaid unto you, Ye ſhall henceforth return no more that way. Ibid.</hi> Theſe words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and in their emphatick ſenſe, can import nothing elſe, but a diſcharging of the King by Forces and Armies to tyrannize over his People, that bringing them into bondage, and upon their ruines he may not ſtrengthen himſelf, and multiply his Forces. So the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> did with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whileas they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> under his tyrannous yoke. (4) Not a Leacherous King, given to women, for drawing him on into temptation. <hi>Neither ſhall he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply wives to himſelf, that his heart turn not away—Ibid.</hi> (5) Nor Covetous, given to enrich himſelf, and to build-up his own eſtate upon the ruins of his People.—<hi>Nether ſhall he greatly multiply to himſelf Silver and Gold. Ibid.</hi> (6) But he muſt be a King, acquiring the Scriptures of GOD, meditating on them his whole life-time, thereby learning to fear the LORD, to obſerve his Commandments, and to practiſe them, that he may be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowly, not turning aſide either to the right-hand or to the left. <hi>And it ſhall be, when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of [that which is] before the Prieſts the Levits. And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall reade therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and theſe Statutes, to do them: That his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren, and that he turn not aſide from the Commandment, to the right-hand, or to the left,—Ibid.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from we draw this Argument:</p>
               <p>The power of him is not Arbitrary, and beyond the bounds of Law; whoſe power according to the Law and Word of GOD is Regulated and kept within the bounds of Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114526:13"/>
                  <hi>But the power of the King according to the Law and Word of God, is Regulated and kept within the bounds of Law:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>the Power of the King is not Arbitrary, and beyond the bonnds of Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denyed, unleſſe men will be ſo bold, as to deny a Regulating and ſquaring of their Acts and Inſtitutions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word and Law of God.

                  <hi>Barclay</hi> the Royalliſt, diſtinguiſheth between the Office and power of the King; and ſo the man endeavoureth to elude our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thus: <hi>The Office of the King</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is ſet down Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>and the King's power is ſpoken of,</hi> 1 Sam. 8 <hi>where</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an Arbitrary power is conferred upon the King, and laid upon his ſhoulders.</hi> But this diſtinction ſerveth not for his purpoſe: For either the power of the King is according to the Word and Law of God, or not. If it be, then as the Office of the King is regulated, in like manner his power alſo is kept within the compaſſe of Law: For his Office ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. admitteth bounds, and is kept within marches. That which is ſpoken concerning the King, <hi>Dent.</hi> 17. <hi>in terminis</hi> doth ſubject the King to Law, and taketh-away Arbitrarines in his Government: So then that which is ſpoken of the King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. doth either contradict that which is ſpoken, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. or elſe it giveth him no power and liberty of governing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Law at random. If it be not, then it is not a Divine but a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolick power. Moreover, what the King doth according to his power, either he doth it by vertue of his Office, or contrary to it. If by vertue of his Office, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Kingly power cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, unleſſe his Office be alſo abſolute: for ſo the exerciſe of his power dependeth from his Office. In ſuch a caſe he can do nothing according to his power, but what he hath Authority for from his Office: But his Office, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17 is not abſolute, but Regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. If contrary to it, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not the Kings Office to exerciſe an abſolute power, and conſequently the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not abſolute. Furthermore, either the King, as King, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, or not. If he be abſolute as King, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Royall Office is abſolute: For the King is formally King by vertue of his Royall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114526:13"/>
Office. If not abſolute as King, then we gain the point: For ſo it followeth, that the Kingly Government in it-ſelf is not abſolute and illimited; and if the Kingly Government in it-ſelf be not of a vaſt and abſolute extent, we Demand, in what notion the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King is Arbitrary and illimited? Either <hi>ab intrinſcco, i.e.</hi> As it is eſſentially a Kingly Authority, or <hi>ab extrinſeco, i.e.</hi> according to ſome cadent and accident of the Regall Office. If the former, <hi>ergo</hi> the Office of the King it-ſelf is abſolute, which is not onely repugnant to that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. but alſo to that which <hi>Barclay</hi> confeſſeth himſelf. If the latter, <hi>ergo</hi> the King, as King, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Office is not abſolute: for, <hi>quod convenit rei acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliter, ei non convenit formaliter.</hi> Then we demand, if the King, as King, be not abſolute, whether, or not, he be abſolute as he is a Judge, or as he is a Man? If as he is a Judge, <hi>ergo</hi> all Judges no leſſe then Kings, are of an abſolute and Arbitrary power, which Royalliſts themſelves do altogether deny; yea, they make the King eſſentially different from other Judges under this notion, becauſe the Kings power is abſolute, and their's is not. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſeing according to the Doctrine of Royalliſts, the King is eſſentially differenced from other Judges as he is abſolute, then <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lint velint,</hi> the King, as King, is abſolute. Thus the Gentlemen do contradict themſelves. If as he is a Man, <hi>ergo</hi> all men, let-be Kings, are of an Arbitrary and boundleſie power; but ſure I am, no Royalliſt will ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Barclay</hi> in-ſteppeth <hi>Salmaſius</hi> on the floor, as one min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cut the knot, if he cannot looſe it: This Gentleman labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (though in vain) to reconcile that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. with that which is ſpoken of the King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. <hi>The Iſraelites</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did not ſeek from God one King onely, but a change of the government by Judges, and in ſtead of that, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a Regall Government: But</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the Prophet to diſſwade them therefrom, propounded to them theſe incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which enſue upon the Kingly government; this the Prophet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> jus Regum, <hi>which I</hi> (quoth he) <hi>call the Arbitrary licence, which is granted as a lawfull power to theſe who govern after a Kingly manner.

The Queſtion is, whether or not that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. is repugnant to that which is ſpoken concerning the King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. This Royalliſt denyeth the one place to contradict the other; and he rendereth no other reaſon for it, but becauſe the Prophet 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. calleth abſoluteneſſe and Arbitrary licence in the Royall Perſon, <hi>jus Regum.</hi> Now the man eſpyeth not the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his own inference which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Prophet</hi> 1 Sam. 8. <hi>calleth Arbitrary power</hi> jus Regum:</p>
               <p>Ergo <hi>that which is ſpoken of the King</hi> 1 Sam. 8. <hi>is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that which is ſpoken of him, Deut.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Whereas this man ſhould prove the conſequence, he doth nothing but playeth upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Well, I deſire him to learn this much, in his probation of the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> he ſtandeth by that, which maketh the contradiction between theſe places the more apparent. We have ſhewed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and he himſelf doth not deny it, That the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. ſubjecteth the King to Law, and diſclaimeth Arbitrary Power in him. And yet this Gentleman will have the holy Ghoſt, to allow and cry-up (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.) abſolute power in the King. This he not only ſaith, but he alſo endeavoureth to prove from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as it is tranſlated and taken by ſome, both in Greek and Latine. But I pray you, Friend, what is this, but to prove a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction upon your ſelf? let it be ſo, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſo taken, as you will have it, (the contrary whereof we ſhal demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate) yet ſhall you never reconcile theſe two places together, but thereby you enforce the more a contradiction between them. and conſequently, according to your way, the conſequence is ſo far from being deducible from the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> that contrariwiſe it is directly repugnant to it. So then, my Friend, albeit I ſhould grant you all that you would have, yet you have this to prove, That though the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114526:14"/>
holy Ghoſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. crieth down Arbitrary Government in the King, and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. proclaimeth it, and alloweth the ſame in the King, yet notwithſtanding the holy Ghoſt doth not contradict Himſelf, and neither of the places is repugnant one to another. Prove this,<hi>Et eris mihi magnus</hi> Apollo. And whereas you only prove the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> you do nothing but beat the air, and proceed <hi>ab ignorantia elenchi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is repugnant to the power, which the holy Ghoſt in Scripture hath confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed upon inferiour Judges. It is clear from the Book of God, that the Lord inveſteth inferiour Judges with power to execute judgment on all, without reſpect of perſons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to do ſo. And conſequently they are inveſted with power, to execute judgment on Kings themſelves. But if the power of the King were abſolute and above Law, then that power which the holy Ghoſt in Scripture conferreth on inferiour Judges, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unlawful, and in vain.</p>
               <p>Royalliſts ſtart much at this Argument. They talk much againſt it, and I wot not what. Becauſe <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſpeaketh moſt againſt it, we ſhall firſtly begin with him.

But becauſe he is very large upon this matter, and for preventing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs to the Reader, we ſhall therefore handle the whole ſubſtance of that, which he replieth and objecteth againſt this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in a following Sub-ſection.</p>

Becauſe <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 17. by the Spirit of prophecie foretelleth their ſeeking of a King after the manner of the Nations. But it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that <hi>Moſes</hi> there doth onely propheſie of their ſeeking a King after the manner of the Nations, <hi>i.e.</hi> that as the Nations about had Kings over them, ſo they might have a King over them in like manner: for both <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. the words are general. In neither of theſe it is ſaid, <hi>Make us an abſolute king after the maner of the Nations.</hi> The words admit a two-fold ſenſe; and ſo they may either ſignifie, As other Nations have Kings, ſo make us a King. This ſenſe we allow; or, as other Nations have abſolute Kings, ſo make us an abſolute King. This ſenſe we deny; And ſo, this is a fallacy, either <hi>ab Homonymia,</hi> or <hi>à figura dictionis.</hi> (2.) We may as well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114526:15"/>
conclude from theſe words, <hi>after the manner of the Nations,</hi> that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſeek a non-abſolute and regulated King: for at that time there were King of the Nations, who were regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to Law. We read, that <hi>Priamus</hi> was not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by his own ſubjects who did ſteal <hi>Helena,</hi> but alſo what he did in the matter of <hi>Helena's</hi> away-taking, was according to the advice and counſell of Senators, whom <hi>Paris</hi> with his Complices did over-awe, <hi>Dict.

Moreover, we do not imagine, but there were many other Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies at that time, which were not arbitrary and of an illimited power. We might prove this at length; if it were not both tedious and needleſſe. But <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth, that then all the Kingdoms of the Orient were of a limited power, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated κατὰ νόμον. And for proof of this he citeth <hi>Ariſtotle, pol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 11. (3.) The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſeek a King under very fair pretences. They not only alleaged, that <hi>Samuel</hi> was unfit becauſe of his years, to govern them, according to Law and reaſon, but alſo they pleaded for a King from the tyrannie of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel's</hi> ſons, and their non-governing according to juſtice and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then tell me, would they ever have ſought a King, that he might govern them according to his pleaſure, whether to tyrannize over them, or not? Thus they ſhould not onely have palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted themſelves, but alſo they ſhould have cut off from themſelves theſe pretences, whereby they urged their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſeeking a King.

whether according to Law, or contrary to it, but that they ſought a King to govern them, only according to Law and reaſon. I am ſure, the ſecond and third end imply no leſſe. And if you ſay, that the firſt end may take along with it a judging, whether according or contrary to Law, we do eaſily obviat this difficultie. (1.) Becauſe you ſhall not finde in Scripture, where judging is taken for an act of injuſtice and tyrannie. And the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth judgment, calling it juſtice, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. (2.) Had the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſought a King to judge them, whether according to juſtice or injuſtice, then their arguments whereby they enforced their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in ſeeking a King, had been altogether uſeleſſe. <hi>Samuel</hi> haply might have ſaid to them, I ſee now ye do praevaricate in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, your profeſſion is altogether vain, in declaring your ſelves ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of my weakneſſe and inability for judging you according to juſtice and equity, and of the corruption and iniquitie of my ſons, in perverting righteous judgment. Away (might <hi>Samuel</hi> have ſaid) this is nothing but words. Whereas ye ſeek a King to judge you, whether according to Law or not, ye contradict your own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and give your ſelves the lie to your face. Yea, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf doth acknowledge, that they did not ſeek a King to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over them, and to rule contrary to Law and reaſon, <hi>Def. Reg. c. 2.</hi> But mark how the man ſtraight-wayes giveth himſelf the lie: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they did not deprecat nor abominat an unjuſt King, wicked, violent, ravenous, and ſuch-like as uſe to be among the Nations, though moſt wicked, Ibid.</hi> We demand at this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whether or not they did poſitively ſeek ſuch a King as that, to reign over them? If he affirm it, then they ſought a tyrannous King to reign over them. And ſo he belieth himſelf. If he deny it, then it followeth, that in even-down terms they ſought no King but one who would judge them in righteouſneſſe. But this Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſt will have them poſitively to ſeek an abſolute King to reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. Then tell me, how can this agree with theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereupon they ſought a King, to wit, to reform their Commonwealth, and to baniſh corruption out of Judgment-ſeats? and becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi> was not able to perform this (as they alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) therefore they ſought a King. But <hi>Samuel</hi> might have ſaid to them in ſeeking an abſolute King, ye ſeek a remedy worſe then the diſeaſe. Such a King whom ye ſeek, having power to govern
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114526:17"/>
at randome, according to his pleaſure, will not be a ſit man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe the enormities of your Eſtate. He may well aggravat the burdens under which ye now groan, but he will not leſſen them, and eaſe you of your burden. Be ſure, ye will get few or no good Kings, but ye will have many bad, who having a vaſt power, will make you groan under their yoke. So then (might <hi>Samuel</hi> have ſaid) ye can no wayes pretend a ſenſe in you of the want of the exerciſe of righteous judgment, and of corruption and enormity in the Judges. Ye ſcorn your ſelves to enforce your purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from in ſeeking a King, whenas in ſeeking an abſolute King, ye forthwith give your ſelves the lie, and undermine your own grounds. Again, if poſitively (as is manifeſt from theſe ends above-written) they ſought no King to reign over them, but ſuch who would govern them according to Law and reaſon; then is it more then apparent, that poſitively they ſought a regulated and non-abſolute King to reign over them: for, as governing according to judgment and righteouſneſſe, is done according to Law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo it can never abſolutely be performed, unleſſe the governing power be abſolutely hemmed in by Law, and regulated thereby. Now, the abſolute ends which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did ſet before their eyes in ſeeking a King, do reſolve upon governing according to judgment and righteouſneſſe. And I would fain know of this man, how he can conclude this conſequence,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The people of Iſrael did ſeek a King, to govern them according to judgment and righteouſneſſe:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>they did ſeek an abſolute King, and did not deprecat the greateſt of tyrants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verily the conſequence, at leaſt <hi>virtually,</hi> is repugnant to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent:</hi> for, in ſo far as they ſeek a juſt and righteous King, fit to govern them according to Law and reaſon, in as far they abominat an abſolute King, one in a capacity of tyrannizing over them. Thus you ſee, that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> do neither <hi>poſitively</hi> nor <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> ſeek an unjuſt and tyrannous King to reign over them.</p>
                  <p>We haſten now to the <hi>Aſſumption.</hi> And we obſerve, that the man contradicteth himſelf in it: for he ſaith not onely, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. but alſo <hi>cap.</hi> 2. that there were many Kings of the Nations at that time ſubject to Law. And for proof of this, he citeth <hi>Ariſtotle, Pol. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> II. <hi>Diod. Sic. l.</hi> 2. But as a man awaking out of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114526:18"/>
his wine he recalleth to his memory, what hath eſcaped him, and laboureth to correct it. And ſo he addeth, <hi>that though</hi> Diodore <hi>ſtoricth, that the Kings of</hi> Egypt <hi>were ſubjected to Law, yet do we never read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ever any of them was cut-off and beheaded by the inferiour judges. And though</hi> Ariſtotle (quoth he) <hi>ſaith that all the Oriental Kings did govern <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, yet not withſtanding they did rule with an abſolute power, though more remiſly then did other Kings. Def. reg. c. 5. &amp; 8.</hi> Albeit this man doth not admit a plenary and full ſubjection of Kings to Law, yet nevertheleſs he is conſtrained by force of example, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Kings were ſome way or other kept under the power and reverence of Law. And he cannot deny but <hi>Diodore</hi> ſtorieth of a moſt wonderful ſubjection of the ancient <hi>Aegyptian Kings</hi> to Law. He telleth us, that they were ſubjected to Law in their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, lying and riſing: yea, in preſerving their health they were reſtricted to Law. And which (ſaith he) is more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they had not power, to judge, to gather Money together, nor to puniſh anythrough pride or anger, or any other unjuſt cauſe. And yet (ſaith <hi>Diodore</hi>) they took not this in an evil part, but thought themſelves happy to be ſubjected to Law. I trow, this is far from <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his <hi>cui quod libet licet.</hi> He will have the King above Law, not ſubject to any Law. But the <hi>Egyptians</hi> will have their Kings under the Law, and ſubject to it. And though this immodeſt man doth ſay, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> notwithſtanding did not cut-off any of their Kings, yet catcheth he nothing thereby. (1) Becauſe the <hi>Egyptian Kings,</hi> as <hi>Diodore</hi> telleth us, were moſt obſervant of the Laws. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Plurimi regum,</hi> the greateſt part of their ancient Kings lived blameleſly, and died honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. <hi>Rer ant. l. 2. c. 3.</hi> But I beleeve that Law cannot ſtrike againſt the innocent. 'Tis iniquity to kill a man, who deſerveth not death. <hi>Diodore</hi> telleth us of three things, which made the ancient <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kings</hi> to walk cloſely, and keep themſelves within bounds. Firſtly, their wayes were narrowly hedged-in by Law. Secondly, they were alwaies attended with the Sons of the Noble and Chief-Prieſts, whoſe eyes were alwayes fixed on them. Thirdly, Kings that walked not ſtraightly, as nothing was proclaimed in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to their praiſe, but to their diſcredit; ſo in their death they wanted the honor of ſolemn and ſumptuous burials, which were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114526:18"/>
given to good Kings, after their death. The fear of this, hedged-in their wayes, and made them ſtand in awe. (2) We deny not, but <hi>Diadore</hi> in that ſame place inſinuates, there were many evil ancient <hi>Egyptian Kings.</hi> Yet we ſay not, tyrannous, as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> would have it: for we do not think, that though many of their Kings were wicked in themſelves, they got liberty to tyrannize over the People. The <hi>Egyptian Laws</hi> were more ſtrict then that they would diſpence ſuch a liberty to any of their Kings. <hi>Diodore</hi> ſaith, they were tied to the Law no leſs then private men. And withal he ſaith, their Judges were moſt impartial, and could not be bought-by, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by favour or gain. Which maketh us imagine, that they hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med-in the wayes of the moſt diſſolute King amongſt them, and did not give him liberty to tyrannize over the People. Therefore it is very obſervable that <hi>Amaſis</hi> getting power in his hands, did ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> Whoſe tyranny the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did tolerate, ſo long (as <hi>Diodore</hi> ſaith) as they wanted the opportunity of puniſhing him, till <hi>Actiſanes</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> came down into <hi>Egypt.</hi> And then (ſaith the ſtory) the <hi>Egyptians</hi> called to mind old quarrels againſt <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and falling from him to <hi>Actiſanes,</hi> they unkinged him, and ſet-up <hi>Actiſanes</hi> in his room, who governed them moſt gently and amicably. <hi>Rer. ant. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. (3) Let it be ſo, many of the <hi>Egyptian Kings</hi> in old did tyrannize over them, and they, notwithſtanding, were not puniſhed, and cut-off by the People and inferiour Judges. What then? That will never conclude their unwillingneſs and unreadineſs to execute judgment on their tyrannous Kings, but that they wanted opportunity and power to do ſuch a thing. So it went (as is ſaid already) with the People and inferiour Judges under <hi>Amaſis</hi> tyrannous yoke. But ſo ſoon as they got the opportunity, they verified the old Maxim,
<q xml:lang="lat">Quod differtur, non aufertur.</q> Yea, <hi>Diadore</hi> telleth us. That the People did withſtand the Prieſts and thoſe, who with-held honourable and ſolemn burials from the bad <hi>Egyptian Kings</hi> in old. Which affordeth us matter to aver, That if the inferiour Judges in <hi>Egypt</hi> did not execute judgment on their wicked and tyrannous Kings, it was not becauſe they were unready to do ſo, but becauſe the People were refractory thereto. No queſtion, they would much more have withſtood the off-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Kings, then the want of ſolemnities at their death: for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114526:19"/>
what is it, I pray you, that draweth People on to act and engage for their Princes, but becauſe they take them up in the notion of half-gods, and far above the reach of ordinary men? Whereupon they conclude, that both their Perſons and Authority are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inviolable. They dote ſo much upon them, that they think they ſhould in no terms be reſiſted, far leſs cut-off and puniſhed according to their deſerts. This, daily experience teacheth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People of <hi>Egypt</hi> would far more have withſtood the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judges in cutting-off their Kings, then in denying them ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ſtately burials for their offences. (4) It is eaſie to belearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Diadore,</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> eſteemed the want of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burials to their Kings more then any puniſhment could have been inflicted upon them. Know this, they were a moſt ſuperſtitious People, tainted with a world of blind zeal. And withall (as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dort</hi> ſtor eth) the fear of the want of honourable and ſolemn burials provoked their Kings to live circumſpectly, and keep themſelves within bounds. Whereupon we conclude, That both King and People, thought no puniſhment more capitall, and more hurtfull to the King, then the want of an honourable buriall. And ſo the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judges imagined, that in with-holding from tyrannous Kings ſumptuous and ſtately burials, they executed more judgment upon them, then if they ſhould have brought them to the Scaffold, and cauſe ſtrike the heads from them. Therefore if <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſhall not admit the third Reaſon, (which though it be true in general, yet not in this particular caſe, as is moſt probable, though not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative) he muſt needs confeſs, that the Prators of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not only in their apprehenſion, but alſo in the up taking both of the King and People, acted more againſt ſome tyrannous King or other, in depriving him of an honourable and ſumptuous buriall after his death, then the Repreſentative of <hi>England</hi> did in bringing King <hi>Charle:</hi> to the Scaffold, and cauſing his head to be cut-off.</p>
                  <p>As for that which <hi>Salmeſius</hi> ſaith, alledging that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that the Oriental Kings in old did not ſimply govern <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. Well, let it be ſo. If they were any wayes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Law, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in even-down terms confeſſeth they were, it is far from <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his <hi>cui quod libet licet.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, according to Law,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114526:19"/>
and in ſome things their power was determinat, and not abſolute. This is far from <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his mind, who will have the King to be of an infinit and illimited power. The man would have a care, that he do not ſpeak blaſphemy and knoweth not of it. I take infinacy in power to be only proper to GOD. And 'tis not good to abuſe it, in applying it to the creature. Howſoever, I heartily ſubſcribe to what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith concerning the Orientall Kings. I do not think but in old, as namely, in, and about the dayes of the <hi>Heroës,</hi> Kings, as Gods, were adored by men. But <hi>Salmaſius</hi> muſt give me leave to ſay, that even then Kings were puniſhed by the People. We read how the <hi>heroick Theſeus</hi> was baniſhed by the <hi>Athenians. Val. Max. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Diod. Sic. rer. ant. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Plut. in Theſ.</hi> I do not deny, but as theſe Hiſtoriographers report, as likewiſe <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid de Pol. Ath. Theſeus</hi> before that time had reſtored liberty to the Subject, and had put Power in the People's hand. It is alſo reported, that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> the King of Kings, was thruſt from his Charge, becauſe he would not ſuffer his eldeſt Daughter to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to ſatisfie the fury of <hi>Diana,</hi> for the Roe which he killed feeding about her grove. <hi>Dict. Cret. l.</hi> 1. That of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> were done about the time the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſeek a king to reign over them. We might alſo here alledge exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of other ancient kings, who were brought into ſubjection to the ſentence of inferiour Judges. But we paſs them as not beſeeming the purpoſe in hand: for they are relative to after ages, of latter years then what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh of. Yet we find one example or two more then what we have alledged already, anſwering to this purpoſe. It is reported that <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> becauſe of his beaſtlineſs and ſenſuality, was dethroned by his Subjects. <hi>Ariſt. Pol. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10, <hi>Metaſth. an. Perſ. lib. Juſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Diod. Sic. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>Miltiades</hi> was incarcerated by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and died in priſon. <hi>Val. Max. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Aemil.

                  <p>Therefore <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſhall do well, not to imagine, that in old times all Kings were abſolute, and the inferiour Judge did not ſit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114526:20"/>
upon the Bench againſt any of them. And for my ſelf, I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but in old, Kings were of a vaſt and abſolute power, though I cannot be moved to think that either all of them were abſolute, or any of them ſo abſolute as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> dreameth of. But more of this afterward. And, I do alſo think, that the <hi>Aſſyrian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, coeteris paribus,</hi> was in it-ſelf rather more, then leſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, then either the <hi>Median,</hi> or the <hi>Perſian;</hi> though by ſome accidental occurrents, as afterward ſhall appear, it was not. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it had the firſt ſtart of them, and was in the time wherein Royal Power was more in requeſt then either before or after.

times did lead him that far on. But though I ſubſcribe to this, yet wil it never therefrom follow, that all the Kings of the Nations at that time, when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſeek a King to reign over them, were abſolute &amp; not ſubject to law. This we have made good already.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: <hi>Whileas</hi> Samuel <hi>taught the</hi> Jews, <hi>of what temper kingly-government is, leſt afterward they ſhould pretend ignorance of the power and right of the king, he plainly declareth unto them, That he might do any thing, without fear of puniſhment, not ſubject to any but to GOD.

                  <p>Thirdly: <hi>If Kings had been ſubjected to the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>and ought to have been arraigned before it, either to have been accuſed or condemned, then had there been no difference between the Judges and the Kings of the</hi> Jewes. <hi>But the latter is falſe: Ergo.</hi> This is <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his great gun. And for proof of the <hi>Major</hi> he faith, <hi>The Judges of the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did judge, led forth their Armies, made Lawes, executed judgement, and did exerciſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch-like functions which are exerciſed by Kings. Therefore unleſſe the Kings of the</hi> Jewes <hi>had been unliable to the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>there had been no difference between the Judges and the Kings of</hi> Iſrael.

So the</hi> Roman Conſuls <hi>referred to the Senat, and the Senat judged of their refer. Therefore ſeing the Judges of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were but like</hi> Conſuls <hi>who were ſubject to the Senat (as the caſe was amongſt the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>and</hi> Romans,)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114526:21"/>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We heartily ſubſcribe to the <hi>Minor,</hi> and do much cry-up <hi>Salmaſius</hi> in the probation thereof. I wiſh the man were as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and pertinent in all the reſt, as in that. Yet I crave his leave to deny the <hi>Major.</hi> And I think, I have good reaſon to do ſo: for he only differenceth abſolute Kings from Judges, imagining that none properly can be a King eſſenitally diſtinct from a judge, but he who is abſolute and unlyable to the Law. He far miſtaketh the point. It is one thing to be an abſolute King, not ſubject to the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> and Senat, and another thing to be a non-abſolute King and ſubject to Law. And yet both are properly and univocally Kinge. The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abſolute King is eſſentially differenced from the <hi>Sophet</hi> or <hi>Sufet,</hi> the Judge, becauſe he is <hi>major ſingulis,</hi> but <hi>minor univerſis in ſyuedrie.</hi> But the Judge is but of equal authority with the reſt of his collegues in the Senat, though becauſe of his eminencie and perſonall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he may praeſide and be as a leading man amongſt the reſt. Such was the caſe of the kings and Judges amongſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as after ward ſhall be ſhewed. There are ſome accidentall differences alſo between the Judges amongſt the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and their kings, as namely, 1. The Judges were in a moſt ſpeciall, immediat, and extraordinary manner, deſigned and appointed by GOD himſelf, to govern his people. Kings were not ſo, if we look to them in an ordinary way, and for the moſt part. 2. The Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no hereditary power and government over them. Such had their kings. 3. The kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> both in their ordination and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114526:21"/>
were attended with prodigall, ſumptuous and Royall Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were denied to their Judges. And whereas <hi>Salmaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> eſſentially diſtinguiſheth <hi>Melech</hi> a king, from <hi>Sophet</hi> a Judge, becauſe the one is of an abſolute power, and the other is not, he ſhal do well to advert, that he loſe not more this way then he gaineth: for ſo he putteth the eſſentiall frame of the king in an abſolute and uncircumſcribed power. But in our firſt argument againſt this, we have ſhewed the incongruity and abſurdity thereof. Which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall more appear from what is ſpoken, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly: <hi>There can be no example alledged in the Book of God, whereby is pointed-out the ſubjection of Kings to Law. We read not, that ever the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>or the people of the</hi> Jews <hi>did puniſh Kings for their faults. And yet many of their Kings were moſt guilty of many great and criminall faults, as namely</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon. <hi>Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This argument is like the firſt. Both of them ſpeak much <hi>de facto,</hi> but nothing <hi>de jure.</hi> This is a very bad conſequence: The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſought an abſolute King to reign over them, and did ſet-up ſuch a King over them: <hi>Ergo</hi> the power of an abſolute King is lawfull, and Kings <hi>de jure</hi> are not ſubject to Law. Friend, you break-off too ſoon. Though I ſhould grant you the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> yet before I can approve the validity of the conſequence, you muſt prove the validity of their practice. You count your reckoning too ſoon, whileas you thus conclude: There is no practice in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holding-out to us that the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrin</hi> did ever execute judgement, on any of their Kings, who tranſgreſſed the Law, and did violate it: <hi>Ergo</hi> Kings are not ſubject to Law. What if I ſhould grant the <hi>Antecedent?</hi> You have notwithſtanding to prove the lawfulneſſe of their non-executing judgement on their kings who tranſgreſſed, before I can at any time ſubſcribe to the conſequence. Philoſophs know (though many Humaniſts do not) that <hi>à facto adjus non ſtatim valet conſequentia,</hi> Aye, they can tell you, that <hi>argumentum negativum nihil concludit.</hi> Well, as I deny your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſo I do not admit your <hi>Antecedent.</hi> I illuſtrate the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it from examples in Scripture, both ordinary and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Ordinary] <hi>Jehojadah</hi> in the face of the Aſſembly commanded to fall upon <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and kill her, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. And though you ſhall deny this practice as concluding any thing againſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114526:22"/>
your purpoſe, yet I pray you, what can you ſay of that practice in killing <hi>Amaſiah?</hi> We have ſhewed elſewhere, that ſuch a thing was done in a Publick and legall way. Extraordinary] The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets rebuked the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> for their faults and tranſgreſſions. And what is rebuke but a degree of puniſhment? And ſo Kings not having immunity from the leſſer degree of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why are they not alſo lyable to the greater, according to their delinquency? <hi>Magis &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> Yea, <hi>Jehu</hi> executing the purpoſe of the Lord on the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſlew both the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. and withall he cauſed cut-off all the ſons of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. O, but you will ſay, Theſe practiſes of the Prophets and of <hi>Jehu</hi> were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And then; It is a very bad Argument: The Apoſtles preached by the extraordinary inſtinct of the Spirit: <hi>Ergo</hi> Miniſters, who have nothing but an ordinary ſpirit, ſhould not preach. So, it doth not follow: The Prophets and <hi>Jehu</hi> acted againſt delinquent kings through an extraordinary call thereto: <hi>Ergo</hi> thoſe, who have nothing but an ordinary call thereto, ſhould not do ſo. It may be you will ſay, The People can have no ordinary call, to act againſt their kings. Be not miſtaken. (1) Extraordinary things ſupply the room of ordinary things, whileas they are wanting. So <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> killed <hi>Agag,</hi> becauſe <hi>Saul,</hi> the ordinary Judge, was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his duty. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. (2) At leaſt it followeth, that the ſame thing, which is done extraordinarily, may alſo be done lawfully in an ordinary way. Otherwiſe many abſurdities and blaſphemies ſhould follow.

The reaſon of this is, becauſe <hi>eſſe extraordinarioe vocationis</hi> is ſo called, and is ſo in it-ſelf, becauſe it ſtandeth in oppoſition to <hi>eſſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria vocationis,</hi> as we have ſhewed at length, <hi>curſ. Philoſophico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theolog. diſp.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. And therefore there can be no extraordinary call for puniſhing Delinquent Kings, unleſſe there be alſo an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary call for doing ſo. (4) Puniſhing of delinquent Kings either in it-ſelf is ſinfull and unlawfull, or not. If ſinfull and unlawfull, then neither ordinarily, nor extraordinarily may Kings lawfully be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: for no ſin can be committed by an extraordinary Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Otherwiſe God ſhould extraordinarily ſin. But we have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114526:22"/>
ſhewed already, that Kings may be puniſhed by vertue of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary call. And conſequently, it is not a ſin in it-ſelf, to puniſh delinquent Kings. If lawfull and unſinfull, I ſee no reaſon why a thing which is in it-ſelf lawfull and honeſt, may not lawfully be done, by ordinary as well as by extraordinary midſes: for either the exerciſe of ordinary midſes is in it ſelf lawfull, or not. None, I am ſure, will ſay, that the exerciſe of ordinary midſes is unlawfull, Otherwiſe every thing that is done ordinarily, is done ſinfully. Which to ſay, is abſurd. And if you ſay that the exerciſe of them in it ſelf is lawfull, then it is lawfull in it ſelf by vertue of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry call, to puniſh delinquent Kings. But if there be any fault and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape in the way and manner of imploying that cal that no whit hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, but the call in it ſelf is lawfull and commendable: for ſuch things are meerly extrinſecall to the nature of the call it-ſelf. And <hi>ab extrinſeco, ad intrinſecum, non eſt ſequela.</hi> (5) <hi>Jehu</hi> and the Prophets, had no other reaſons for them in ſpeaking and acting by vertue of an extraordinary call againſt delinquent Kings, but what thoſe may have in proceeding againſt them, by vertue of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry call. They no otherwiſe proceeded againſt them by vertue of their extraordinary call, but as it was for the good of the LORD's People, and for executing Juſtice on their delinquency, that others might learn not to offend.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114526:23"/>
King is of an abſolute power, and not ſubject to Law. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Athaliah</hi> being inveſted with the right of a Kingly power and authority, ſhe was no more ſubject to Law, then any other of the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> Therefore if you ſay that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the right and authority of a King, you muſt either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the practice of <hi>Jehojadah</hi> and the people in killing her, or elſe you muſt charge your opinion, and not imagine Kings to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and not ſubject to Law. If ſhe had not the right and authority of a King then either becauſe ſhe uſurped the Kingdom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded her-ſelf upon it, contrary to the conſent of the People, or becauſe ſhe did cut-off the righteous heirs of the Kingdom, and ſet up her-ſelf in the Kingdom, or elſe becauſe according to the Law women ought not to govern. Not the firſt, because according to the Doctrine of Royalliſts, conqueſt is a lawfull title to the Crown. But <hi>Athaliah</hi> conquered the Crown of <hi>Judah</hi> to her-ſelf. What more I pray you, did ſhe in intruding her-ſelf upon the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> then unjuſt Conquerers do, in thruſting themſelves in upon the kingdoms which they ſubdue? As ſhe intruded her-ſelf, without the free conſent and election of the People, ſo do they. And yet <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> with the reſt of his Brethren, will have ſuch Conquerers lawful heirs, and abſolute kings over theſe kingdoms, which they ſubdue. Nor can you ſay the ſecond, becauſe conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who ſubdue other men's kingdoms, cut-off all thoſe who by pretended blood-right, claim a title to the Crown. And yet Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts will have ſuch lawfull heirs, and abſolute kings over theſe kingdoms, to which they have no title but the ſword. Nor can you ſay the third, becauſe all Royalliſts admit Royal birth, a juſt and abſolute title to the Crown. But women no leſs then men may be and are of the Royall Off-ſpring. And conſequently, if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Royalliſts be true, and unleſs <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will contradict himſelf, women may as lawfully govern as men: Therefore it doth not follow, that becauſe <hi>Athaliah</hi> was a woman, ſhe had not right to govern the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and reign over them. I confeſſe, by Royall birth ſhe had no title to the Crown. But ſhe conquered the Crown to her-ſelf, and did reign ſix years with the conſent of the People. But ſure I am, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and all the Royalliſts, as they hold the conſent of the People, as a neceſſary ingredient to make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up the lawfulneſs of the title to the Crown, ſo they maintain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114526:23"/>
without all exception, to be a juſt and lawful title thereto. But what need I thus to ſtand? do not I know that <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and the whole nation of Royaliſts will have the formall and eſſentiall being of the King to conſiſt in an abſolute and illimited power? But any perſon, whether man or woman, uſurper or non-uſurper, is capable of ſuch a power, and may be inveſted therewith. And conſequently, though <hi>Athaliah</hi> was but a woman, and an uſurper, it doth not follow, that becauſe ſhe was ſuch, therefore ſhe was not of an abſolute and arbitrary power. The greateſt of Tyrants, and the worſt of women, is capable of ſuch a power. And the power is not changed, becauſe of the change of the perſon, and of ſuch and ſuch qualifications in him. Such things are meerly extrinſecal to the nature of the power it-ſelf. So then, if the King be formally a King, becauſe he is of an illimited and arbitrary power; I ſee no reaſon why <hi>Athaliah</hi> did not reign as a King: for ſhe was capable of ſuch a power, wherein, according to the doctrine of Royalliſts, the eſſentiall frame of a King doth conſiſt. And conſequently, ſeing ſhe did reign in ſtead of the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and exerciſed his authority, there is no reaſon why ſhe was not abſolute and unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Law, as well as he. Therefore <hi>Salmaſius</hi> muſt either leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off his opinion, and not imagine that the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and not ſubject to Law, or elſe he muſt cry-down the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice of <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> and of the People, in killing <hi>Athaliah.</hi> For ſhame he will not do this.</p>

Howſoever I ſhall do my endeavour to find him out. And that I may take away the ſtrength of all that he objecteth, and leave not ſo much as the ground-ſtone thereof, I lay down theſe following Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>Concluſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe of extraordinary heroiciſme and gallantry of old, ſome were of a ſimply vaſt and abſolute power, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſubject to Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we make good from the condition of ſome Kings, both before and after the Flood. Before the Flood, the point is clear. About the 500 year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s age, which was in the 1556. year of the world, Policy began to have ſome footing: for then men began to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own inventions &amp; hearts deſires; and ſo men then a-dayes being of huge ſtrength, and undaunted courage, given to pleaſure and renown, thoſe amongſt them, who by ſtrength of hand could carry the pre-eminence and precedency over others, no leſs perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it then endeavoured it. <hi>And</hi> Noah <hi>was five hundred years old,</hi>—Gen. 5. <hi>There were Giants in the earth in thoſe dayes, and alſo after that when the ſons of God came-in unto the daughters of men, and they bear [children] unto them, the ſame became mighty men, who [were] of old men of renown, Gen. 6.</hi> Hence mark theſe two things. 1. That in the 500. year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s age there were men of a gigantine ſtrength, mighty men, given to hard and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exploits, minding their own honour and renown. 2. That ſuch men lived at random, not ſubject to law, nor under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of any. Their extraordinary valour and deſire of renown led them on to rule, and not to be ruled. <hi>Therefore they took them wives of all which they choſe, Gen. 6.</hi> Their awleſs and lawles living, maketh the Lord ſay, <hi>My Spirit ſhal not alwayes ſtrive with man,Ibid.</hi> But the faithful Hiſtorian, <hi>Beroſus,</hi> giveth us great clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114526:25"/>
in this matter. He ſaith that before the Flood there was a City called <hi>Oenon,</hi> about <hi>Libanus,</hi> a receptacle of Giants, who did reign over the whole world, from the Occident to the Orient. Theſe (ſaith he) conſiding in the vaſt ſtrength and ſtature of their body, having found Arms and Engins of war, oppreſſed all and governed according to their pleaſure. <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>After the Flood the firſt King we read of, is <hi>Nimrod;</hi> of whom it is ſaid. <hi>And</hi> Cuſh <hi>begat</hi> Nimrod,—<gap reason="foreign">

I need not to ſtand here in a particular and exact way, to prove that theſe Kings had an abſolute immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from Law, without all reſtriction and reſervation. But to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the curious ear alittle therein, we ſhortly make it good thus. 1. Theſe Kings came not to their Crowns, whether by election, or ſucceſſion. At leaſt all, that they commanded fell not to them, either of theſe wayes. They held the right to their Crown by their ſword. And ſo over-ruling all by force and ſtrength of hand, they could be tied to no Law by any civill ſanction, but as they pleaſed voluntarily to ſubject their necks to the yoke of Law. But as they delighted to over-rule men, no queſtion they have thought it their glory to be I kew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> did live according to the Lawes. Yet I do not think that it was by command, but according to their own free and voluntary reſignation.

Indeed there is great difference between a Kingly power had by ſucceſſion, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and a Kingly power obtained by conqueſt and ſword-right. In an elective and heriditary Crown, people have at leaſt a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power, to binde the King to them by Oath and Covenant. But the caſe is far otherwiſe between a conquered people and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. They have no power to tie him to them by Law. He may put them all to the edge of the ſword, if he will. And it is in his own goodneſs whether to ſpare them, or ſquare himſelf according to their Laws. Experience teacheth to-day what boundleſs power the <hi>Turk</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have over thoſe Kingdomes to which they have no title, but ſword-right. Therefore it is no wonder though theſe grand and matchleſſe Heroes had an arbitrary and boundleſſe power over the Kingdomes, which they conquered by ſtrength of hand. 2. The men themſelves were eſteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as Gods. And ſo by proportion a GOD-like power was given unto them. <hi>Nimrod</hi> was called the <hi>Babylonian Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Libyan Jupiter.</hi> The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> hold <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Ninus</hi> as Gods. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhipped <hi>Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> as Gods. So did the <hi>Grecians</hi> honour <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> as Gods. And <hi>Alexander</hi> thought no ſhame to be called the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and honoured as a God. And as <hi>Ninus</hi> was holden as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> ſo <hi>Semiramis</hi> was holden by them as <hi>Junc,</hi> and worſhipped as a Goddeſſe.

And ſo it followeth that <hi>Belus, Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him were rather more then leſſe abſolute then he: for as every one of them enlarged their power beyond another, ſo all of them extended their power beyond what <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s power did reach to.

Becauſe he commanded <hi>Darius</hi> to write to him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to a King, but alſo as to his King. 2.

it followeth, that the reſt of the foreſaid Heroes were rather more then leſſe abſolute then he. 1. Becauſe they were men, if not of greater courage, at leaſt of greater ſtrength then he.

Some of them were planted a long time after, while-as all the Countries round about, where they took up their reſidence, were afore-hand planted.

                     </gap>eneſs of the heads of the firſt ſort of Colonies was more intenſe then that of the other. 1. Becauſe the heads of the firſt ſort were holden and worſhiped as gods. Thus <hi>Cur</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Saturn</hi> of <hi>Aethiopia, Chemeſenuus</hi> the <hi>Saturn</hi> of <hi>Egypt.

They could not be honoured and eſteemed as gods, unleſs a God-like power had been aſcribed unto them. But we judge, that the after-planted Colonies, who came in upon other men's ſhare, ſheltering under their wings, and receiving places of abode from them, had no proper gods of their own, but honoured thoſe as their gods, from whom they received the places of their reſidence and abode. So the <hi>Thuſcits</hi> worſhiped <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Jupiter, i. e. Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> who are Egyptian gods. Theſe they worſhip, becauſe <hi>Hercules, Oſiris</hi> ſon, who is alſo called <hi>Jupiter,</hi> erected them, and gave them his ſon <hi>Thuſous</hi> to reign over them. Yea, the <hi>Tyrrhenians</hi> do not worſhip <hi>Tyrrhenus,</hi> though he was their firſt King, but <hi>Janus</hi> who was the firſt planter of <hi>Italy,</hi> by whoſe Colonies <hi>Janus</hi> had planted there, <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly received.

And ſo, we do not think, but the firſt and primary Founders of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms, (as <hi>Meſe</hi> and <hi>Getulis,</hi> who erected the Kingdom of the <hi>Maſagets</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> as did <hi>Anamae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:114526:28"/>
And as the firſt and primary Founders of Kingdoms are holden as <hi>Saturns,</hi> &amp; primary gods, ſo their firſt-born are holden as <hi>Jupiters</hi> and <hi>Junoes,</hi> &amp; the chiefeſt of their grand-children as <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uleſes.</hi> And ſo, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaith, the ſecondary gods are multiplied according to the multiplication and diverſity of the primary gods. So then, ſeing the primary Kingdoms, and firſt Colonies have their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gods, and the ſecondary Kingdoms, which were planted in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the chief parts of the Continent being afore-hand planted by primary Colonies, had no proper gods, but ſuch as were common, both to them, and the primary Colonies, or the firſt inhabitants: It is evident to us, that the heads and leaders of the ſecondary and after-Colonies, had no ſuch abſolute power as the heads and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the primary Colonies. The power is proportioned according to the honour and reſpect people give to their Kings and Rulers. A primary honour, a primary power, a ſecondary honour a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power. And conſequently, the Kings of the primary Colonies being attended with a primary reſpect, whereas the Kings of the after-Colonies got but honour in a ſecondary way; no queſtion, the power of the one was more intenſe, then the power of the other. 2. Becauſe the heads of the after-Colonies being in after times, were neither men of ſuch ancient deſcent and root, as the heads of the primary Colonies; nor do I think they were men of ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtrength as they. Strength and courage was the more in vigour, how much more they approached the youth and beginings of time. Time's youth declining, man's youth alſo faded. After-time, after-ſtrength. And withall, after-Colonies coming in upon other men's lot, both the Law of courteſie and obligation (unleſſe the primary Colonies by way of gratification, or elſe in ſimplicity, had paſt all claim of priviledge over them; of which we read nothing, neither is it probable) did tie them to hold one way or other of the former and primary inhabitants. This maketh nothing againſt the abſolute power of their own proper Kings, though they honoured the firſt Kings of the primary Colonies, as gods. They might very well have acknowledged their own proper Kings, as their abſolute Lords, though aſcribing a divine and more intenſe honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the firſt Kings of the primary Colonies. This maketh us think, that the <hi>Thuſcites</hi> (albeit <hi>Thuſcus</hi> was their proper King) held <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> (though <hi>Hercules</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians</hi>)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114526:29"/>
as <hi>Jupiter. Idem quoque qui unis populis eſt Hereules alieris eſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</hi> They held of <hi>Heroules</hi> more then of <hi>Thuſcus. Thuſcus</hi> was their King, but they had their being and reſidence of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Whereupon we conclude, that the firſt of Kings were moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, of a more vaſte and intenſe power then Kings of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and ſecondary Colonies. Yet we cannot deny but even ſuch were abſolute alſo, they being men of great valour and courage, and not onely ſuch, but even thoſe from whoſe conduct and means the being of their people did in a moſt ſpecial manner depend. They did not only govern them, as a people, but they made them a people. But not withſtanding this, I cannot imagine that their power was ſo abſolute, as that it admitted no reſtraint. And ſo in reſpect of them, I take <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by the hand, who ſaith that in the dayes of the Heroes Kings were abſolute, though ſome of them in ſome things were reſtricted. <gap reason="foreign">

But afterwards we ſhew, that <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> meaning is concerning Heroes of the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary rank, and ſuch who in after-times erected Kingdomes and planted Colonies.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as there were colonies planted in old, by way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhelter and gratification, (as were the <hi>Griphcnians,</hi> the <hi>Tyrhenians,</hi> and the colonies of <hi>Phaeton</hi> and <hi>Auſon</hi>) ſo colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were planted by way of commiſſion and ſubordination. So the <hi>Aſſyrian, Median,</hi> and <hi>Magogan,</hi> colonies were planted in <hi>Aſia,</hi> together with the <hi>Moſcits,</hi> who at one time erected their taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europ.

This they did by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Commiſſion which <hi>Aſſyrius, Me us, Magogus,</hi> and <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> their four chief leaders had from <hi>Nimrod.</hi> I can not imagine that ſuch had a vaſte and arbitrary power over their colonies: for what power they had over them was by way of Commiſſion, and in ſubordination to the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy.</hi> But we ſhal not ſtand much to grant that even ſuch had an abſolute power over their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, though not ſo vaſt &amp; intenſe as that of <hi>Nimroa's.</hi> 1.Becauſe though the Princes of theſe colonies were ſubordinate to <hi>Nimrod,</hi> yet it is very likely that their Colonies had no power over them: for as the being and reſidence of theſe colonies did in a moſt ſpecial
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114526:29"/>
manner depend from the conduct and means of their Princes and leaders, ſo then a-dayes people did much adore Princely Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they knew very little then what it was to call conſiſtories and exerciſe the Lawes, <hi>Xenophon</hi> telleth us, that <hi>Ninus</hi> was <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> to the <hi>Aſsyrians. De aquiv.</hi> and ſo we conceive, that their <hi>Hercules</hi> hath been <hi>Aſſyrius,</hi> their firſt Prince and leader: for ſo by proportion <hi>Nimrod</hi> was their <hi>Coelum, Belus</hi> thir <hi>Saturn, Ninus</hi> their <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and conſequently their <hi>Hercules</hi> behoved either to be <hi>Aſſyrius,</hi> or elſe <hi>Saturn's</hi> grand-child. <hi>Xenophon</hi> alleadgeth that the chieſeſt of <hi>Saturns</hi> grand-children are the <hi>Herculeſes.</hi> But <hi>Belus</hi> had not a grand-child who ſucceeded to him in the Kingdom. And ſo we ſuppoſe that their <hi>Saturn</hi>'s grand child being wanting, they have con ſerred the honor of <hi>Hercules</hi> upon their own native Prince. And what the <hi>Aſſyrian colonies</hi> did in that purpoſe, is moſt probable the reſt of the foreſaid colonies did the like alſo. And ſo they conſerring a Divine honour upon their Princes and firſt leaders, no queſtion they have given them all obedience and abſolute ſubjection. And <hi>Aſhur</hi> (whom <hi>Beroſus</hi> calleth <hi>Aſſyrius</hi>) is reckoned up <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. as a very mighty and active Prince. 2. Becauſe <hi>Hered</hi> though a precary and ſubſtitute King, yet was he not ſubject to Law &amp; was declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable to any for the murder which he had committed againſt <hi>Ariſtobulus.

                  <p>Furthermore obſerve, there were ſome Colonies planted by meer purchaſe.

And as for the Kings and heads of ſuch Colonies, I ſee nothing againſt it but they have been of an abſolute and arbitrary power: for as they planted their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, without all obligation to the natives, ſo the beeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of their people did more intimately depend from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and means, then any of theſe ſorts of colonies, we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-of already, did depend from their Captains and leaders.

Here meer purchaſe carrieth the buſineſſe, but there the buſineſſe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried-on by the free donation of others, and by lot, or land for the up-taking. Thus the colonies were the more oblidged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and induſtry of their Leaders. Whereas in the plantation of Colonies according to this laſt ſort, they are extremely engaged to the endeavour and conduct of their heads and overſeers. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me think the fondneſſe of the people, in aſcribing too much to their induſtry, hath made them devolve their whole power over upon their Kings, who by their conqueſt and purchaſe made them a people, and poſeſſed them in land.</p>

But before this time they were all of one minde, without all ſedition and diviſion. Then men conveniently lived without any Civill and Politick Government; for ſo they lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Noah</hi> as under a common father, receiving the Law from his

mouth, and withall every one of his poſterity did know, how that nature had laid moſt ſtrict and neer bonds of relation upon each one to other.

Men then were given more to Piety then Policy. They were little, or rather nothing acquainted with the rules of complex Policy. They ſtudied more to entertain ſimple ingenuity, and the ties of pure nature, then to rule one of them over another. Hence faith <hi>Archiloshus</hi> that 250. years after the flood, there was a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den age, in which Nature it ſelf lived within the bounds of Law, without all politick ſanction, ever and while <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> by force of Armes began to corrupt the way of Man's living. <hi>Lib. de temp.</hi> So faith <hi>Mneſ.

Whereupon we need not fear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, but <hi>Noah</hi> then had a vaſt and abſolute power. And this may be conſidered two wayes in reſpect of the object of his power. 1. In reſpect of good. And ſo I do not think but he had a power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al limitation, to order and govern every thing in an orderly and beſeeming way. Firſtly, becauſe he was the common father of all, and by nature it-ſelf had the precedency over them. Secondly, the caſe then was extraordinary: for at that time he was the only man who beſt knew how to order and govern affairs. Men at that time were little or nothing acquainted with Lawes and conſtitutions. Knowledge and Learning were but in their beginnings then. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ignorance of theſe times neceſſarily called them to take the word at <hi>Noah's</hi> mouth, who was extraoidinarily endowed with grace and knowledge from above. None like him in his time. All the reſt weak and ignorant in reſpect of him. Therefore ſeing he had the precedency before all, not onely in reſpect of nature, but alſo in reſpect of gifts and graces, and not onely ſo, but likewiſe all ſtood in need at that time of information from him, no queſtion all the reaſon in the world maketh for an abſolute power in <hi>Noah,</hi> in reſpect of every good thing. Thence it is ſtoried of him, that he went abroad from Country to Country planting Colonies, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering things wherein GOD's honour and the peoples weal were concerned. 2. In reſpect of evill. Indeed I will not ſay that ſuch a Saint of GOD as he, did take on him a power to rule at randome, and according to his heart's luſt. I conceive indeed, he took upon him an abſolute power, to govern according to Law, but not againſt Law. Neither did he take on him ſuch a power, becauſe he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to govern, and to be above others. No verily. But becauſe he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114526:31"/>
was neceſſarily called to govern ſo. Both the precedency in reſpect of nature, and likewiſe in reſpect of gifts, as alſo the weakneſs and ignorance of the times, called him to over-rule all according to Law, with a vaſt and full power. His government was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and by neceſſity. And therefore we can conclude no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary government from it, (abſolutely to govern according to Law) devolved-over upon the ſhoulders of one man, or of ſome few. Much leſſe can there be concluded therefrom a power of governing contrary to Law, without all bounds of limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Albeit I make it no queſtion, whether <hi>Noah</hi> took upon him an abſolute power of governing, whether againſt, or according to Law; yet do I think it very probable that none at this time would have taken it upon them, to have judged him, accuſed him, or condemned him. 1. No queſtion, drunkenneſs is puniſhable by Law: But we hear of none that did ſo much as rebuke him for it, but <hi>wicked Cham,</hi> who therefore derided him, and was therefore accurſed. 2. He was the common father of all at that time. 3. Of all at that time he was the moſt reverend, wiſe, and eminent. 4. They knew little what it was to hold Affizes, and call Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. All which move us to apprehend, that none at that time would have dared to judge him, even albeit he ſhould have deſired them. <hi>David</hi> far inferiour to him, wanting many priviledges over his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which <hi>Noah</hi> had over his in the golden age, notwithſtanding both his adultery and murder, was ſpared and over-leaped by the <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> was not judged by it, notwithſtanding his idolatry and multiplication of wives &amp; horſes; which were puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and inhibited by Law. And yet <hi>Solomon</hi> had no ſuch priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges over his people, as <hi>Noah</hi> had over his poſterity. And I do verily beleeve, that the emency of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and becauſe they were extraordinary perſons, moved the Sanhedrin to ſpare them. Yea, it is to be conſidered, that ſuch eminent men do not fal through a prepoſterous and malignant humour, but through an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary deſertion of God, for noble and high ends beſt known to God himſelf. No queſtion, this hath been taken to heart by the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin. And this being conſerred with the eminency and ſingularity of the men, hath carried the Sanhedrin by, from inſticting puniſhment upon them. I ſhall not ſtand to diſpute, whether they did this <hi>de jure,</hi> or not. But ſure I am, as they did it <hi>de facto,</hi> ſo they-have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114526:32"/>
been much moved thereto from pregnant conſiderations of the men's perſonal endowments. And for my ſelf, though I think a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſubject to Law, yet would I think it a great temptation to me, (though as Judge) to ſentence ſuch a man with death. The emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the man, and the way of his falling would put me to my ſecond thoughts, albeit I ſhould endeavour nothing therein but juſtice. Well, call it injuſtice in the Sanhedrin to have ſpared <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet would I not have you to wonder too much thereat. There is great difference between a <hi>David</hi> and an <hi>Ahab,</hi> a <hi>Solomon</hi> and a <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Such are not all dayes men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt needs ſay, that as the Sanhedrin ſpared <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> from thoughts of the ſingularity and eminency of the men; far more would <hi>Noah</hi>'s poſterity, in the golden age, have ſpared <hi>Noah,</hi> though in many things delinquent: for as the man was moſt eminent and ſingular, and could not have fallen but by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary deſertion, and for moſt good and noble ends, ſo he had a priviledge from Nature above all in his time. Yea, in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, people were well ſeen in Laws and politick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. The Sanhedrin needed not to have ſpared <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> through ignorance and want of skill. But it was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the golden age in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time. Then men were but Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, and ſpelling the firſt ſide of the Catechiſme of Policy. Every thing was but in its beginnings, in its firſt rudiments. Let it be ſo, that <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> in the golden age, <hi>Noah</hi>'s poſterity denied not to him an abſolute and uncircumſcribed power. I ſeek no more but that. And I may ſay, that though at that time <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto, Noah</hi> ſhould have had immunity from the exerciſe of Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, though much delinquent, yet ſhall I not think that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Noah</hi> claimed ſuch a priviledge to himſelf, as competent to him <hi>de jure,</hi> and according to the Law.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Noah</hi>'s authority and power, after his poſterity was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into factions before we can determin upon it, you ſhall mark with me, immediatly after the golden age, that there were three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and diſt not parties. 1. The godly party. 2. The heroick party. 3. The politick party. The godly party was of the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Shem.</hi> Theſe followed <hi>Noah,</hi> and walked in his wayes. The heroick, and politick party were of the poſterity of <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> And as the heroick party followed <hi>Nimrod,</hi> ſo the politick
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114526:32"/>
party followed <hi>Ham,</hi> whom the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> call <hi>Chemeſenuus.</hi> No queſtion, <hi>Noah</hi> immediatly after the golden age had a vaſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over the godly, and thoſe who walked in his wayes. You may learn the reaſons of this from what is above-written. And as for the heroick, and politick party, it would ſeem probable, that they contemned <hi>Noah</hi> and ſlighted his Authority: for they walked contrary to his wayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.11. It is known how that <hi>Ham</hi> (the head of the politick, yea and of the magical party) did mock <hi>Noah, Gen. 9. Beroſ. ant. lib.</hi> 3. Yea, <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the head of the heroick party, contrary to the mind and purpoſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Babel</hi> to be built, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Ber. ant. lib.</hi> 4. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this we may ſay, that at the moſt it concludeth that ſuch were diſobedient to <hi>Noah,</hi> and walked contrary to his will. But it will not conclude that ſuch denied to <hi>Noah</hi> immunity from the Law. <hi>V. g.</hi> A prodigal and riotous ſon may work and act contrary to his father's will: But it doth not follow, <hi>ergo</hi> ſach a child doth ſtrike and puniſh his father. Nay, a debording child may act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his father's wil, and be ſo far from eclipſing his power over him, that he may in patience endure his correction over him. So we read that <hi>Ham</hi> did not repine againſt his father's reproving and curſing him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. Yea, <hi>Beroſus</hi> ſtorieth, that <hi>Noah</hi> did ſhut him out from his preſence, and he did ſo accordingly, <hi>ant. lib.</hi> 3. And beſide that he telleth us, that <hi>Noah, Nin. an.</hi> 19. gave him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſtay beſide him three years in <hi>Italy.</hi> But finding, how he did corrupt the Colonies there, he commanded him to be gone, and he did ſo. And yet at this time he was the <hi>Saturn</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty King, and of great power, both in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in <hi>Italy. Ant. lib.</hi> 5. I think there is very good reaſon for it, to ſay, that <hi>Noah</hi> in ſo far had an abſolute power over them, as that none of them in a direct and poſitive way would have acted againſt his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſpiſing him as an enemy, and as one on whom they would and did execute their fury. The moſt we can call them, is diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but not rebels to <hi>Noah.</hi> They acted againſt his will, but not in deſpight of his will. They took not liberty from him, to do his will, though they took liberty to do their own will alſo. We can not think that the light of Nature was ſo far extinguiſhed in them, that they did not honour him as their father. A debording ſon, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> can entertain <hi>Iſaac</hi> with Veniſon, though he walk not in his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114526:33"/>
wayes. And I do not think, if they had not honoured him as their common father, unleſſe they had been extraordinarily reſtrained, they had deſtroyed him and all his followers. Sure I am, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not power to do ſo. The godly party was but an handful in reſpect of them. What then, I pray you, could be the ordinary mean of their reſtraint, but their natural reſpect and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him? Nay, they honoured him ſo much, that they eſteemed him their <hi>Coelum,</hi> their <hi>Sol,</hi> their <hi>Chaos,</hi> the <hi>ſemen mundi,</hi> yea, and the father, both of the greater, and leſſer gods, <hi>Ber. ant. lib.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And what we have ſpoken of <hi>Noah,</hi> the like alſo may be ſaid of <hi>Adam.</hi> Before the Flood there was alſo a golden age 1556 years. Wherein men lived as under one common father, each of them knowing the intimate relations one to another, until Monarchy was erected, till the cloſe of the 500 year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s age, as is ſhewed already. Before which time <hi>Adam</hi> had died 626 years, and <hi>Seth</hi> 514 years. But ſo long as <hi>Adam</hi> lived, what ſuperiority <hi>Noah</hi> had over his poſterity in the golden age after the Flood, <hi>Adam</hi> had it rather in a more then leſte meaſure then he. <hi>Adam</hi> was not onely their common father, but alſo he was their firſt and primary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>As we have evinced the truth of this point, from examples in Scripture, ſo we may evidence it from examples in humane Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>V. G.</hi> The <hi>Mitylenians</hi> gave to <hi>Pittacus</hi> an abſolute power of governing becauſe of his perſonal endowments. <hi>Diog. La. de vit. Phil. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pit. Ariſt. Pol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. The like power did the <hi>Athenians</hi> confer upon <hi>Solon,</hi> upon the ſame accompt, <hi>Diog. La. de Sol. Plut. in Sol.</hi> So it is alledged, that <hi>James</hi> 6. becauſe of his pretended perſonal endowments, obtained an abſolute power and a negative voice in Parliament. In the <hi>interim</hi> obſerve, That thoſe who allow abſolute Monarchy, becauſe of perſonal endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do not imagine that Kings have an abſolute power becauſe they are Kings, but as they are ſuch Kings, <hi>i. e.</hi> Kings not only in reſpect of ſtation, but alſo in reſpect of qualification, exceeding all others. And ſo they conclude, that a King ſo qualified may very conveniently be entruſted with an abſolute power: for they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that though ſuch a man have power above Law, yet will he not act againſt Law. And likewiſe they imagine, that ſuch a man
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114526:33"/>
being in all reſpects above all men, both in reſpect of ſtation, and qualification, can no wayes be inferiour to any man. Thus <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> inclineth to abſolute Monarchy of this moulding, <hi>Pol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11, &amp; 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ. 4.</hi> Kings in old were of an abſolute power, without the bounds of all reſtriction, by vertue of purchaſe and conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>So were the grand Heroes, as is ſhewed already. Hence was it, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the Kings of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> had an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over the People of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ. 5.</hi> Kings in old, by meer uſurpation and tyranny, had an abſolute power, without any circumſcription.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had an abſolute power over the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the wicked Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (at leaſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) over their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had an abſolute power, not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo over all his ſubjects. Of whom it is ſaid,—<hi>Whom he would be ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he ſet-up, and whom he would he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, Dan.</hi> 5. After this manner <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> had an abſolute power over the people of the <hi>Jews;</hi> though we deny not, but what either of them did act or intend againſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> was by the mediation of evil Counſellours. So had <hi>Herod</hi> an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>Joſ. Ant. lib.</hi> 15. Yet we deny not, but it was through other men's means more then his own, that he had a power to tyrannize and govern at random. The ten perſecuting Kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. had an abſolute power over the People of God. But moe examples of Tyrants you may read, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. and 9.2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 12. In the books of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha,</hi> as <hi>Tob.</hi> 1. <hi>Jude</hi> 2. &amp; 3.1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 10.2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4. 14. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> See alſo <hi>Beroſ.

What needeth us ſo to accumulate quotations and examples, when as it is evident, both from divine and prophane writ, that there have been almoſt, <hi>tot Tyranni, quot Reges?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ. 6.</hi> Vnleſſe it had been for ſome of theſe cauſes above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, there was never at any time any King ſo abſolute, but one way or other, according to Law, his power was reſtricted.</p>
                  <p>In eſtabliſhing this Concluſion, we obſerve this order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſtly,</hi> we prove the point from example. And in doing ſo you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114526:34"/>
will do well to obſerve, that examples to this purpoſe are of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold kind. 1. There are ſome which point-out to us, That Kings in old were no leſſe ſubject to Law, then any of the People. 2. Some of them ſhew to us, That though the King's power for the moſt part hath been abſolute, yet notwithſtanding in ſome caſe or other it hath been hemmed-in by Law. Of the firſt kind we have exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both in the dayes of the Heroes, and in after-times. That in the dayes of the Heroes, ſome Kings were no leſſe ſubjected to Law then the People, may be examplified both from the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as alſo from the condition of ſome Kingdoms amongſt the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But we forbear till afterward, to ſpeak any thing of the <hi>Jewiſh Commonwealth.</hi> And amongſt the Heathen, you have to begin with the ancient and ſtately Kingdom of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It cannot be denied, but the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> in old were moſt preciſely hedged-in by Law. Whatſoever they did, was according to Law. They wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they waſhed, they lay with their wives, they did eat and drink, according to Law: They wrote Letters, and diſpatched Meſſages according to Law. It was not permitted to them to treaſure-up ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to judge or puniſh any at random and according to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but as privat men they were ſubjected to the Laws, the yoke of which they did bear patiently, willingly ſubmitting themſelves thereto, and eſteemed themſelves happy to be ſubject to them. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. Sic. rer. ant. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. This <hi>Diodore,</hi> as he confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hath from the writings of the <hi>Egyptian Prieſts,</hi> which he dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched, as he ſaith. Out of whoſe writings he giveth us three reaſons, why the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were for the moſt part good and kept themſelves within bounds. 1. Becauſe the ſons of the chiefeſt Prieſts, who were the greateſt and the moſt learned of al the reſt, beyond the age of twenty years, were ordained to attend the King day and night: By whoſe on-looking and preſence, the King was taught reſervedneſs. 2. Becauſe the Laws were moſt exactly and preciſely exerciſed on the King's Perſon. 3. Becauſe the Prieſts, as both before death, and after death, did celebrate the praiſes of the good Kings, honouring them with hyperbolick encomies, ſo they ſpake both before, and after death, to the diſcommendation and diſparagement of the bad and wicked Kings, depriving them of ſtately Exequies at their interring. Now the deſire of the one, and the fear of the other, kept them back from extravagency and debor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114526:34"/>
and cauſed them cheerfully to take with the yoke. <hi>Ibid.</hi> And, which is more to be wondered at, <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> one of the grand and primary Heroes, ordained Prators, as Judges, to govern in the Land of <hi>Egypt. Diod. rer. ant. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. The care of every thing was caſt over upon them. Yea, <hi>Beroſus</hi> telleth us, That <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> whom he calleth <hi>Hercules,</hi> delivered <hi>Italy</hi> from tyranny and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. <hi>Ant. lib.</hi> 5. This inſinuateth, that this Noble Conquerour delighted much to live according to Law, when-as he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure tyranny to be exerciſed in a ſtrange Kingdom, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. Far leſte I think, would he have ſuffered tyranny to be in his own Kingdom. The like alſo did his father <hi>O ſiris</hi> (whom <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> calleth <hi>Simandius</hi>) in <hi>Italy. Ber. ant. lib.</hi> 5. Him <hi>Beroſus</hi> calleth <hi>Jupiter</hi> the juſt. I conceive he could not have been ſo called, unleſs he had been a man that walked ſtrictly according to Law. And if theſe two glorious Heroes, and noble Conquerours did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to Law, how much more the reſt of the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> in old, who were far inferiour to them? Let it be ſo, theſe two lived according to the Law, <hi>ex voluntate,</hi> but not <hi>ex loge,</hi> yet will it conclude (if we compare arightly the highneſs of them with the lowneſs of the reſt) that the reſt <hi>ex lege</hi> were ſubject to Law. So faith <hi>Diod. Ant. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Where he alſo faith out of the <hi>Egyptian Writers,</hi> That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> chooſed-out the beſt men of their chiefeſt Cities, of whom they made-up a Judicatory, not inferiour either to the Councel of <hi>Athens,</hi> or the Senat of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> judging all impartially without reſpect of perſons. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> obſerveth, That it is a ſign of a well governed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, where neither tyranny, nor ſedition is. <hi>Pol.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. But we read not, but very ſeldom, that in old either of theſe was in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> See <hi>Beroſ. ant. lib. Maneth. de Reg. Egypt. lib. Diod. Sic. rer. ant. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1, 2, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it as a rule, for preventing ſedition, and keeping the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in its integrity, to govern according to Law, and to abſtain from tyranny. <hi>Pol.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. &amp; 10. The like do all Politicians, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the conſent of <hi>Machjavel,</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius.</hi> But it is known, that the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as in old there was ſeldom ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in it, ſo likewiſe it endured a long time inviolable. Which makes us conclude, that the <hi>Egyptian Kings</hi> kept themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds, refrained from tyranny, and walked according to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114526:35"/>
Law. But they could not ordinarily and for a long time have done ſo, unleſs they had been ſubordinate and ſubjected to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilours and Parliament. The proverb is, <hi>Who get Liberty, do take Liberty.</hi> And for the moſt part, it alwayes holdeth good.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not imagine that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the days of the Heroes were ſingular in this matter. The <hi>Athenians</hi> under <hi>Theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had a Kingly government, rather like a Commonwealth then Monarchy. Therefore faith <hi>Heraclid,</hi>

Queſtionleſs, the Army never gave him ſuch a power as that over them, whereby in the time of

'Tis ridiculous to ſay, that the General of an Army, hath power to ſell the whole Army to the Enemy, and the Army may not reſiſt him in ſo doing in the time of battel, though the Army may withſtand him at any other time.

Which appeareth to have laſted during both the time of the Kings, and likewiſe of the Princes. And conſequently ſeeing there was a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114526:37"/>
in both their times, there could be no difference in their power. But that we may give an exact and punctuall anſwer to this pre-occupation, you ſhall take notice of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition of the <hi>Athenian Commonwealth,</hi> and of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof. Firſt, before <hi>Theſeus</hi> reign, we do not imagine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were governed, not onely by a Kingly government, <hi>Ber. art. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Maneth. de reg.

Pol.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>and</hi> 11. Secondly, under <hi>Theſeus</hi> reign the power of the Kingly government was much impaired. Then the people were reſtored to liberty, and got power in their hand, as is ſaid already. Therefore <hi>Euripides</hi> faith, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> under <hi>Theſeus</hi> did not come under the yoke of one man, but the people as free men governed like a King by courſe. <hi>In Theſ.</hi> Yet we muſt not imagine that then there was a perfect and entire Commonwealth erected. No, verily: for <hi>Theſeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained notwithſtanding as their Prince, and as one having grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority then any Patriot and Commonwealth's-man. I will not ſay that <hi>Theſeus</hi> retained a power in his hand, equall to the power of the People, and their Repreſentative. That is expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what <hi>Euripides</hi> and others above-cited do report. But this much I may ſay, that he retained as much power in his own hand, as made him ſuperior and of greater authority then any one at-leaſt, whether of the Councel, or of the People. And that he was the firſt man in dignity and authority in the Commonwealth is clear. 1. Becauſe as both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> report, he remained notwithſtanding the Prince of the Commonwealth. Therefore even unto this day he is reckoned-up in the Catalogue of the <hi>Athenian Kings.</hi> 2. Becauſe he differenced between the <hi>Patricians</hi> (whom we call gentle-men) tillers of the ground, and Crafts-men, giving to them power according to their ranks and ſtations, inveſting ſome of them with greater, and ſome of them with leſter power: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſeing he differenced one kinde of perſons from another in the Commonwealth, making ſome of them in authority Superiour to others, much more hath he retained a power in his own hand, whereby he was differenced from any amongſt all the reſt. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Codrids</hi> and thoſe who ſucceeded him, were properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                     </gap>, the Princes, and diametrally oppoſed to them. But I conceive that there was greater reaſon why <hi>Theſeus</hi> was a King then they were. He was heroick, and not ſo were they. Yea, <hi>Heraclid</hi> in plain terms faith, that Kings were not abrogated from amongſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> till the poſterity of <hi>Codrus</hi> became effeminate and lecherous. At which time (faith he) they were taken-away, and Princes put in their room. Obſerve therefore, that from <hi>Theſeus</hi> untill the laſt of the <hi>Codrids,</hi> the <hi>Athenian Monarchy</hi> was regulated. We eſtabliſh the point thus. 1. Becauſe <hi>Theſeus</hi> himſelf (as is proved already) was regulated: <hi>Ergo</hi> far more <hi>Codrus</hi> and his poſterity were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated. <hi>Theſeus</hi> was of an heroick temper, ſuch as were not the <hi>Codrids.</hi> And ſo by nature he was more diſpoſed for an abſolute way of governing then they. He lived in an heroick time, wherein Monarchy was moſt in requeſt. But their time was of another ſtamp wherein Monarchy was wearing-out of requeſt. 2. Becauſe, while<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Grecians</hi> carried-on an Engagement againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> at that time the <hi>Athenian Monarchy</hi> remained regulated alſo. <hi>Juſtin</hi> faith, that <hi>Demophoon</hi> ſon to <hi>Theſeus</hi> was Captain of the <hi>Athenian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> which went out with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> againſt the <hi>Trojans. lib.</hi> 2. But we believe other more antient Writers rather then him, who ſay, that the Captain of the <hi>Athenian navy</hi> then was <hi>Mneſtheus, Theſeus</hi> ſon. <hi>Dict. cret. de bel. Tro. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Dar. Phr. de exs. Tro. lib.</hi> and <hi>Homer. Iliad.</hi> 2. Howſoever <hi>Plutarch</hi> gathereth from the way of <hi>Homer</hi>'s ſpeaking of the Navy, which came from <hi>Athens,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Mneſtheus,</hi> that <hi>Theſeus</hi> government was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and much impaired: for (faith he) <hi>Homer</hi> doth call theſe ſhips, as belonging to the People. <hi>in Theſ.</hi> Juſt ſo ſay <hi>Dictys Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis, &amp; Dares Phrygius.</hi> And ſo <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s way of reaſoning holding good the <hi>Athenian Monarchy,</hi> whether under <hi>Mneſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as ſome ſay, or under <hi>Demophoon,</hi> as <hi>Juſtin</hi> faith, was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute but limited: for the ſhips which were rigged out of <hi>Athens,</hi> againſt <hi>Troy</hi> were not called <hi>Mneſtheus</hi> or <hi>Demophook</hi>'s ſhips, but ſhips belonging to the people of <hi>Athens.</hi> Well, I reverence this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, not for it-ſelf (for <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaketh that ſame way of the out rigging of ſhips in other <hi>Grecian Kingdoms,</hi> where I do not think but there was abſolute Monarchy, though in ſome things peradventure circumſcribed) but for <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s authority. And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114526:38"/>
ſo in this matter reſting upon it, I conclude, that ſeing the <hi>Atheni. an Monarchy</hi> was kept within the bounds of Law, in the dayes of <hi>Mneſtheus</hi> and <hi>Demophoon</hi> two brave Heroes, much more was it of a circumſcribed power in the dayes of <hi>Codrus</hi> and his poſterity, who were but of an ordinary and non-heroick temper. And as for <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> himſelf, I do not think that ſuch a man would have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the away-taking of thoſe liberties wherewith <hi>Theſeus</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whereas in maintainance of their liberties he expoſed himſelf to the undergoing of death it-ſelf. <hi>Val. max. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Juſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Plut. in Codr.</hi> Aye, and which is more, whileas the <hi>Codrids</hi> became lecherous, loft, and effeminate, the <hi>Athenians</hi> did abrogate Kings from amongſt them, and changed their Kings into Princes. Which beareth us this much in hand, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did retain a power in themſelves, whereby they might either keep-in or ſhut-out their Kings. And it is remarkable that it is not ſaid they did abrogate their Kings, becauſe of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the <hi>Codrids. Heracl. de Pol. Ath.</hi> Which inſinuateth that notwithanding their perſonall eſcapes and out-breakings, they acted nothing for diminiſhing the peoples Power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after the <hi>Codrids</hi> had become effeminate, and had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed their power, the people took-away Kings from amongſt them, and in their room ſet up Princes. Now, the queſtion may be moved whether or not had theſe Princes as great power as had <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Codrus?</hi> For removing of this difficulty obſerve, that there were ſome who did govern onely as Princes, and ſome did rule as Kings. Thoſe who governed as Princes are of a threefold kind. 1. Some of them were appointed to govern for their whole lifetime. Who were thirteen in number, each of them reigning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. 2. Some of them were decennal Princes, ſeven in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who governed every one of them for the ſpace of ten years. The laſt of the decennall Princes was <hi>Erixias,</hi> whoſe government left-off, <hi>an. mun.</hi> 3282 before the reign of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> about 128. years. 3. Some of them were annuall and yearly Magiſtrates. Some would think it ſtrange to ſay that theſe three kinds of Princes had that ſame power and authority which <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Codrus,</hi> or any other of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Kings had. But if you take along with you this diſtinction, you ſhall find the matter clear. There is a twofold non-abſolute and circumſcribed power. 1. Intenſive and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114526:38"/>
ſubſtantiall. 2. Extenſive and circumſtantiall. It cannot be denied but theſe Princes in all the three kindes had one and the ſame power, <hi>intenſively</hi> and <hi>eſſentially,</hi> which <hi>Theſeus</hi> and the <hi>Codrids</hi> had. The reaſon of this is becauſe the power of the <hi>Athenian Kings</hi> in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and at the utmoſt was but a regulated power ſubjected to the Law of the people, as is proved already. Therefore ſaith <hi>Euripiàes,</hi> bringing-in <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſpeaking of the power of the <hi>Athenians,</hi>

But if you ſhall alledge that the yearly Princes amongſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> had not ſuch power as the decennal Princes, and thoſe Princes who keeped the government for their life-time, I ſhall not ſtand much to yeeld that: for I ſuppoſe that as in ſome accidental and circumſtantial way, in the matter of power the <hi>Athenian Kings</hi> were differenced from the <hi>Athenian Princes,</hi> ſo it is moſt probable that after ſuch a manner, theſe three foreſaid kindes of <hi>Athenian Princes</hi> were differenced each-one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore it is alledged that a Commonwealth was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected amongſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> till annuall Princes were ſet over them. Which maketh the Princes of the firſt and ſecond kinde, though not of the third, to be reckoned up as Kings. Yet they muſt give me leave to ſay, that though the <hi>Athenian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> was not fully and compleatly eſtabliſhed till the up-ſetting of annuall and yearly Princes; notwithſtanding in ſome degree or other, there was ever a Commonwealth amongſt them, from the dayes of <hi>Theſeus</hi> untill ſome of their annuall Princes began to uſurp and brought them under bondage: for not onely, as is ſaid already, their Princes of the third kinde, but alſo their Kings and Princes of the firſt and ſecond fort were ſubjected to Law, and the people had a ruling power over them. And ſo all of them had the like power according to the effentiall frame of a regulated and non-abſolute power, though the Kings had a more vaſte authority, and might extend their power further according to Law then the Princes, and thoſe of the firſt kinde, then the Princes of the ſecond, or at leaſt of the third kinde, Even-as Majors, <hi>v. g.</hi> have greater power then Alder-men, and Alder-men then Counſellours.

                  <p>Thoſe Princes who governed as Kings did uſurp a greater power then what according to the fundamentall government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the inſtitution of <hi>Theſeus</hi> did belong to them. So <hi>Cylon</hi> endeavoured, but his attempt was choked in the bud. <hi>Herod. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Thucid. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Herac. de Pol. Ath. Cic. de leg.

And as for theſe Princes we deny not, nor can we ſay otherwiſe, but they had, not onely as great, but alſo greater power then any of the <hi>Athenian Kings,</hi> whether <hi>Theſeus</hi> or any King that ſucceeded him. And that they were of equall power at-leaſt, is evident: for they did reign not as Princes, but as Kings. <hi>Her. de Polit. Ath.</hi> And <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> (one of theſe uſurping Kings) in his Epiſtle to <hi>Solon</hi> ſaith plainly that he walked according to <hi>Solon</hi>'s Lawes, differing in nothing from the people but in honour and dignity. But he addeth, that he took upon him that power which the <hi>Athenians</hi> conferred upon <hi>Codrus</hi> and his poſterity. And in this he acknowledgeth that he ſailed, and had ſuch a power, not by the Law of the Kingdom, but by a Law of his own making. Whence it is evident that <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> by uſurpation took upon him as great power as did <hi>Codrus,</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:114526:40"/>
or any of his race. Yea, and that they had greater power, is alſo clear: for <hi>Juſtine</hi> ſtorieth, That after <hi>Codrus,</hi> while-as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Republick vvas given over into the hands of yearly Magiſtrates, the King's luſt became the People's law. Thus he telleth us, that in the times of defection, and vvhile-as corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entered the State of <hi>Athens,</hi> Kings became abſolute and vvere of an arbitrary povver. <hi>Poſt Codrum,—adminiſtratio Reipublicae annuis Magiſtratibus permiſſacſt.

But we muſt think, that he adviſed with <hi>Solon,</hi> after he had put in execution <hi>Thraſibulus</hi> counſel: for <hi>Solon,</hi> in his Epiſtle to him, telleth him, That the way to ſecure himſelf in his Kingdom, was, not to cut-off any, but to lay-down his lording power over them.

This could not be in the time of his tyranny, when he made havock of his people, and of which <hi>Heraclid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, before he entereth a-talking any thing of his juſtice and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs. Which is more then apparent to us, that he became a juſt and moderat man, leaving-off his tyranny and oppreſſion, upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s counſel and advice. And ſo we fear not to ſay, that he did put power in the peoples hand, adding a Councel to him, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him within the bounds of Law.

Yea <hi>Chilo,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Periander,</hi> though in a ſatyrick way, is little or nothing different from that vvhich <hi>Solon</hi> counſelled him to.

                  <p>Regal Government amongſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in after-times was regulated, and in all things ſubjected to Law. But you will do well to conſider with me theſe things. 1. As <hi>Carthage</hi> was in its beginnings. 2. As it was in after-ages. In the firſt reſpect, it cannot be denied, but Regal Government in it was abſolute. Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe <hi>Dido,</hi> the firſt founder of <hi>Carthage</hi> was worſhipped by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> as a Goddeſs. Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Dide,</hi> by her own proper induſtry builded <hi>Carthage,</hi> and made the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> a People. <hi>Juſt. lib.</hi> 18. Thirdly, Becauſe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Kingly Government was moſt in requeſt. And therefore King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the beginning were governed by Kings. So ſay <hi>Ariſtotle, Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Saluſt.</hi> Then men were little acquainted with the rules of Policy. Which makes <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, that Kingly Government in the beginning was eſtabliſhed, becauſe it was then difficult and hard to find-out many men of wit and judgment, to govern the Commonwealth. <hi>Pol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. We ſhall therefore not judge it ſtrange, that Kings in the beginning of any Kingdom were abſolute and of an arbitrary power. People then had not policy, and knew not how to exerciſe Law aright, and to keep their Kings within the bounds thereof. But according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reſpect, we muſt think that there was a change in Court. Then the <hi>Carthaginian Kings</hi> became ſubjected to Law.

And in this the manner of Royall Power amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> is not wanting. The power of the King was ſubjected to the Senate. <hi>Rex ad Senatum referebat. Pomp. Let. de mag.

                  <p>Inſt. 2. <hi>Ariſtotle doth ſo</hi> (faith <hi>Salmaſius)</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe the power of the battell was hereditary to the Lacedemonian Kings.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe the Lacedemonian Kings in battell had a full free and Kingly power. Aye,</hi> (faith he) <hi>they had alſo a power in thoſe things, which related to the ceremonies, wherewith Kings in old were ſolemnly entruſted.</hi> Def. Reg. cap. 8. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The firſt reaſon is forthwith nought. 'Tis a bad conſequence: The <hi>Laceàemonian Kings</hi> were hereditary Commanders of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in chief: <hi>Ergo Ariſtotle</hi> becauſe of that calleth them Kings. <hi>Zuaſi vero</hi> he had had no ſuch reaſon for him to call them Kings, if they had onely been entruſted with the power of the battell by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Friend, you are a-little miſtaken in this. 1. Becauſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> divideth the power of the battell into hereditary and elective power. <hi>Pol.</hi> 3.<hi>cap.</hi> 10. Thus he contra-diſtinguiſheth the one from the other, as two different ſpecies properly and ſpecifically differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the power of the battell in generall. 2. Becauſe a Kingly power is not therefore Kingly, becauſe it is hereditary. Yea, which is more, a Kingly power, <hi>cater is requiſitis,</hi> is properly and formally elective. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould have had more reaſon to have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them Kings, if their power had been by election, and not by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114526:44"/>
So the man himſelf judgeth whileas he faith, that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> and <hi>Cretian kings</hi> were better ordained then the <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick;</hi> Becauſe (faith he) the <hi>Laconick kings</hi> are ordained by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and they by election. And he addeth a reaſon to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith he, by election the beſt are chooſed, whereas by blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the like cannot be had. Whereupon (faith he) the heridita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry title of Kings amongſt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hath brought great hurt and detriment unto the Commonwealth. <hi>Polit.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. And as for his ſecond reaſon, it plainly contradicteth himſelf: for ſo he confeſſeth, that in the battell they had a Kingly power. And he hath little reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called them Kings becauſe they had a power of over-ſeeing the ſacrifices. So had the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian annuall Princes,</hi> whom properly he will not admit to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Kings, Howſoever it cannot be denied, but properly they were Kings, albeit they were ſubjected to Law. 1. Becauſe it doth not follow that a King properly is not a King, becauſe he is a regulated King. We have ſhewed already, that GOD no otherwiſe moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the King, but as he ſubjecteth him to Law. <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 2. And afterward we ſhall ſhew how that the Kings of the <hi>Jews</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Kings. And yet who will deny but they were proper Kings? 2. The King is not properly King, unleſſe he be a regulated King and ſubjected to Law, as both already and afterward is ſhewed. And therefore the <hi>Lacedemonian Kings</hi> were Kings properly, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they were regulated. 3. Becauſe <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, that in the battell the <hi>Lacedemonian Kings</hi> had a full and Kingly power. And yet then their power was not abſolute and arbitrary. They had not then a full power to act againſt Law, but according to Law, as you may learn from <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 6. in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their power with <hi>Agamemnon's</hi> power. Therefore either <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will contradict himſelf, or elſe he muſt needs ſay, that Kings are properly Kings, though they be regulated. 4. Becauſe all that write of the <hi>Lacedemonian Commonwealth,</hi> of whom we have cited many already, do call the Captain-Generals of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Kings. And 'tis remarkable that <hi>Lylander</hi> in an oration, which was found after his death, perſwaded the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to ſhake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off the Kingly government, and elect a Captain-Generall for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the battell. <hi>Plut. &amp; Aemyl. prob. in Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See how the man bewrayeth himſelf: for <hi>Lyſander</hi> was Captain-Generall of the <hi>Lacedemonian Army.</hi> And yet he was not their King. Therefore amongſt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> it was one thing to be King, and another thing to be Captain Generall of the Army. I confeſſe their King had alſo the power of the Army. But he had not onely other power beſide, but alſo he had power of the battell in a more intenſe way then any deputed and ſubſtituted Captain amongſt the people. Otherwiſe there had been no difference between <hi>Lyſander</hi> and the King, who was but onely Captain of the Army. Yea, which is more, <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> doth not ſpeak of ſhaking-off <hi>regium nomen,</hi> but <hi>regiam pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem</hi> as is clear out of <hi>Probus.</hi> But ſure I am, <hi>regia poteſtas</hi> is not <hi>nomen regis,</hi> but <hi>res regis.</hi>

Having thus diſcuſſed the grammary of the word, you may obſerve, that in it's firſt acceptation it is not onely relative to thoſe who in old were above Kings, but alſo to thoſe who were inſeriour to them. And in the ſecond acceptation it is relative to ſuch, who amongſt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both <hi>re,</hi> and <hi>nomine</hi> Kings, and amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> to ſuch who were Kings, not <hi>nomine,</hi> but <hi>re.</hi> But if we take <hi>ſufetes</hi> preciſely for <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetim,</hi> (unleſſe you take <hi>ſophetim</hi> in a larger ſenſe then it is taken in the book of the <hi>Judges</hi>) you muſt needs ſay, that it is onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to ſuch who were Kings neither <hi>re</hi> nor <hi>nomine:</hi> for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I ſhall make it appear, that the Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo far from being of a Kingly power, that contrariwiſe they were but of equall authority with any of the Sanhedrin. At leaſt it is eaſy to prove that they were not of a Kingly power, or of ſuch power as had the <hi>Roman conſuls,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginian ſufetes,</hi> albeit we ſhould ſay that they were the firſt of the Sanhedrin, having greater power then any of the reſt: for the <hi>Athenian annuall Princes</hi> had more power then any member of the <hi>Athenian councel,</hi> and yet they were not properly Kings. We may ſay the like alſo concerning the decennal Princes, and thoſe Princes who amongſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> did govern for their life-time. I deny not but theſe may be, yea and were, called Kings, who were not ſo indeed, as the Judges of <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 18, And, we deny not, (as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will have it, <hi>Def. reg. cap.</hi> 8.) but many both of old and new alſo were and are not called Kings, who were and are of greater honour &amp; authority then they. What then? This will never conclude, that the <hi>Carthaginian ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetes</hi> were not of a Kingly power. Though the word <hi>ſufetes</hi> may be taken for <hi>ſophetim,</hi> yet ſhall we never conclude therefrom, that the <hi>Carthaginian ſufetes</hi> had no more Power then the Judges of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> At the moſt it concludeth, that they had not a kingly power in a full and intenſe meaſure. And therefore the word in its moſt native ſignification is all one with <hi>Conſules,</hi> who had a kingly power, though not in the higheſt degree. And for my-ſelf, I can
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114526:45"/>
find no eſſential difference between the <hi>Carthaginian Sufetes,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonian Kings.</hi> Whereupon I am made to conclude, That as the one, ſo the other alſo, were of a kingly power.</p>
                  <p>This man looketh upon the off-cutting of Kings, as a thing of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, even as if ſuch a thing had never been practiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the world began. He telleth us of <hi>Agis,</hi> how that amongſt all the <hi>Lacedemonian Kings,</hi> none was cut-off but he. But in the <hi>interim</hi> he ſhall obſerve, that though in the examples which we ſhall alledge to this purpoſe, there be ſome of them which ſpeak nothing of the off-cutting of Kings. Yet all of them do ſpeak of the puniſhment of Kings, either one way or other. And know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that in old, Kingdoms in puniſhing of capital faults, uſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wayes of puniſhment. Amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> the delinquent, though guilty of the greateſt crime, got no more for his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to be ſhaved at the King's command. This was thought amongſt them a capital puniſhment. <hi>Nicol. Damaſc. de Mor. gent. Ind.</hi> Some Nations, who dwelt about <hi>Cancaſus,</hi> on capital tranſgreſſours did execute baniſhment, as a capital puniſhment. They executed it inſtead of death. It is reported, That the <hi>Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> thought it puniſhment enough to inflict upon a murderer, if he did give a buſhel, or meaſure, of Pulſe to the friends of the defunct. The <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Cercets,</hi> for the greateſt faults, did no more, but interdicted the delinquent from being acceſſory to the ſacrifice. The like puniſhment was alſo executed upon ſacrilegious perſons in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephantine Ethiopia. Alex. ab. Al. gen. di. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. Where if the Reader ſhall be pleaſed a little to trouble his eyes, he ſhall ſee how that ſome Nations in old, according to the Laws of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in their puniſhments were moſt ſevere, though againſt the ſmalleſt faults, and ſome were not ſo, but were moſt remiſſe in their puniſhment, though againſt the greateſt crimes. Therefore <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſhall not think, that thoſe, who did not puniſh their Kings with death, were any more favourable to them, then thoſe, who did bring them to the ſcaffold and cut-off their heads: for he may ſee, that amongſt ſome Nations, even a ſmall puniſhment was thought capital. We ſhall therfore think, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of old in with-holding ſtately and glorious burials from their delinquent Kings, did eſteem that as great, if not a greater puniſhment, then if they ſhould have brought them forth, and cauſed cut-off their

Concerning the fact, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> cannot get it denied, albeit he ſtrives to juſtle us out of it, by changing the ſtate of the queſtion, and ſtarting aſide from that, which for the preſent is moſt in hand. And I wonder much, that the man calleth in queſtion the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fact of the <hi>Roman Senat,</hi> in cauſing <hi>Nero</hi> to be cut-off.

Antichriſtian. In this he was worſe then <hi>Nero,</hi> more dangerous at leaſt, though not ſo groſſe. <hi>Nero</hi> was a paricide, but not <hi>Charls.</hi> Yet let me tell you, as they differed in ſome things, they agreed in other things. As <hi>Nero</hi> was an enemy to Chriſt's reign, ſo was he. As <hi>Nero</hi> was a murderer, ſo was he. As <hi>Nero</hi> was a perſecuter of the Saints, ſo was he. And as <hi>Nero</hi> was a deſtroyer of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſo was he. And as for the Repreſentacive of <hi>England,</hi> they differ from the <hi>Roman Senatours</hi> in this, that they profeſſed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Chriſt, &amp; the <hi>Roman Senatours</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time were not ſo. And who, but enemies to Chriſt, will ſay, That Ethnicks had more power to execute judgment on a Tyrant, a perſecuter of the Saints, and a deſtroyer of the Commonwealth, then ſuch had in executing judgment on a man of that ſame ſtamp, rather worſe then better?</p>
                  <p>And to draw home to our own doors, we will give you ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh Chronicles,</hi> how Kings were puniſhed and brought upon the ſtage.

Or rather, what will the <hi>Scots</hi> ſpeak of them? O marvelous and unſpeakable Providence! Never enough admired, never enough praiſed: Behold, and ſee in this matter the ſtately ſteps of Providence. It is known this day to the world, that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo malignant as <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo much idolizeth a King, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon him as it doth: It is not aſhamed, to poſtpone Chriſt's Intereſt to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. No Nation pleadeth ſo much for abſolute power to the King, as it doth; It pleadeth for an abſolute immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the King, from all puniſhment and reſtraint. And yet (albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I have read moſt of the ancient and chief Chronicles of all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt and chiefeſt Kingdoms of the world) I never read of any Kingdom that proceeded ſo much againſt, and ſo often did puniſh delinquent Kings, as the <hi>Scots</hi> in old have done. No queſtion, our LORD in his wiſdom hath done this, that the <hi>ancient Scots</hi> may ſtand up in judgment to-day, to condemn the practice of the <hi>latter Scots,</hi> who are not aſhamed to idolize a King, a creature like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

As for this time, there may be ſomething ſaid for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſle of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings. If we ſpeak of thoſe Kings whom the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> deputed, it is likely, they had an abſolute power, by derivation from the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> as had <hi>Herod</hi> from <hi>Antonius,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Senat. Joſ. ant. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. And whileas the <hi>Engliſhes</hi> were ſubdued by the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> I think it no wonder, though then the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had an

We deny not but under the reigne of the Conquerour himſelf, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Government in <hi>England,</hi> was of a moſt abſolute and arbitrary power.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114526:49"/>
as an abſolute Lord to rule over all. In the <hi>interim</hi> I deſire <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> to take a view of <hi>Polyd. Virg. Angl. hiſt. lib. 9.</hi> where he ſhall find the point evidenced to his heart's deſire, beyond any Hiſtorian he citeth. Although in this we go-along with him (as we muſt needs do) yet notwithſtanding we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſo much, whether concerning <hi>Edward</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, or thoſe who ſucceeded him. Let it be ſo, that thoſe who ſucceeded the Conquerour, had the ſame priviledges which the Conquerour did arrogat to himſelf. Yet can it not be denied, but according to <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour his Lawes, or as they are called, the ancient Lawes of the Kingdom, Kingly Government in <hi>England</hi> is regulated, and not abſolute. We make the point good from theſe reaſons. Firſtly, becauſe according to theſe Laws the King of <hi>England</hi> is not hereditary. And therefore we read not, that ever <hi>Edward</hi> did tie the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to Royall ſucceſſion. I confeſſe, it is alledged, that he promiſed the Crown after him to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, (who was of neer kinred and great credit with him) if he had not children of his own. But this is not only improbable in it-ſelf, but alſo it is ſo judged. And why ſhall we think other wayes of it, ſeing the Conquerour came not to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by blood-right, but by meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, having the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> againſt him? And <hi>Polydore</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hinc colligere licet, vel</hi> Edovardum <hi>non ſervaſſe ſidem</hi> Gulielmo, <hi>quam à principio de hereditate regni, non ſatis conſiderate dediſſet,—vel nullum (qnod veriſimilius eſt) fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſe promiſſum. Angl. hiſt. lib.</hi> 8. This he gathereth from that which <hi>Edward</hi> ſpake to <hi>Haraldus,</hi> whileas he prayed GOD, that either he would avert the comming of <hi>England</hi> into the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours hand, or elſe that he would keep him back from it ſo long as he lived. Therefore to me it is more then apparent, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour did not in his Teſtament aſſigne the Conquerour to the Crown, albeit <hi>Salmaſius</hi> alledgeth the contrary, <hi>Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 8. What? Doth not <hi>Polydore</hi> tell us, that becauſe <hi>Edgarus</hi> was of young and tender years, he was not admitted by the people to reigne? And fearing leſt the Conquerour ſhould ſucceed to the Crown, they rejoyced greatly, that <hi>Harald</hi> took upon him to reigne in <hi>Edward</hi>'s room: Whereat (as may be learned from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi>) <hi>Edward</hi> was not diſpleaſed himſelf, but very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114526:49"/>
that <hi>Harald</hi> ſhould ſucceed to him. Whereupon we fear not to ſay, that not onely the power of enkinging was in the people's hands, but alſo, that the Confeſſour did not promiſe the Kingdom to the Conquerour after him, although the contrary be alledged. And is it likely, that the people would have ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and withſtood the Conquerour, if <hi>Edward</hi> had aſſigned him to the Crown as his heir? No verily; for they adored him as their Law-giver. It is known, that <hi>Rufus</hi> was but third ſon to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, and yet he was created King. Him the people preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Robert</hi> his eldeſt brother. What? Would they have done ſo, if blood-right, by the Law of the Kingdom, had been the title to the Crown? No verily: It is remarkable, that <hi>Rufus</hi> was ordained King, and it was not ſo much as objected, that <hi>Robert</hi> was elder then he, he being but the third ſon to the Conquerour, and <hi>Robert</hi> being the eldeſt. Yea, <hi>Rufus</hi> dying without children, they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Henry,</hi> the Conquerours fourth ſon, King; as yet paſſing-by <hi>Robert</hi> the eldeſt. And (which is more) though <hi>Henry</hi> 1. had left in his Teſtament, his daughter <hi>Mathildis,</hi> together with her ſons, as heirs of the Kingdom, yet not withſtanding the people crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Steven,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Henry</hi> 1. By the authority of Parliament it was ordained, that <hi>Steven</hi> ſo long as he lived, ſhould enjoy the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>Henry</hi> 2. ſon to <hi>Marthilais,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Henry</hi> 1. ſhould ſucceed to <hi>Steven</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> paſſing by any that was begotten by <hi>Steven.</hi> Likewayes the people created <hi>John</hi> King; although <hi>K. Richard</hi> (dying without heirs) had leſt <hi>Arthure,</hi> ſon to <hi>Gaufredus,</hi> who was elder then <hi>John,</hi> heir to the Crown. I might ſpeak more for clearing this put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but I forbear, judging this ſufficient. Whence it is more then evident, that the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour, by no Law of the Kingdom, is hereditary. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, ſince that time, now and then, the Kings eldeſt ſon did ſucceed, and was holden as Heir of the Kingdom. But this was onely by cuſtome, through favour of the Race, in which, according to the manner of Nations, (which I muſt needs call an abuſe) very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the firſt-born, is preferred as the onely lawfull Heir of the Crown. Therefore ſeing the Crown of <hi>England</hi> ſince that time hath not been (at leaſt, preciſely) hereditary; to me it ſeemeth very probable, that for that time it hath not been abſolute
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114526:50"/>
and arbitrary: for ſo the original and fountain-power of enkinging is in the People's hands. And conſequently in this reſpect, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſimply above the King, as the cauſe is ſimply above its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Philoſophers ſay.

                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe, according to theſe Laws, the liberty of the ſubject is vindicated, and the Prince is ſubjected to Law. Becauſe in <hi>Henry</hi> 1. his time, a Parliament was holden. At which time Parliamentary Power by the Law of the Kingdom was declared the Supream and higheſt Authority: for any thing of weight was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to it. So that whatſoever was done, either by the command of the King, or of the People, it was holden null, unleſſe it had been ratified by the Parliament. In it every one, whether King, or other Members thereof, have alike and equal power of ſpeaking. And withall, nothing ſpoken in it is of validity and force, unleſſe it be concluded on by the <hi>major</hi> part, together with the approbation of the King. <hi>Polyd. Ang. hiſt. lib.</hi> 11. It is obſervable. That by the authority of the Parliament it was ordained, That <hi>Steven</hi> ſo long as he lived, ſhould remain King of <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>Henry</hi> 2. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhould ſucceed him. By whoſe mediation and authority, the debate between <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Steven</hi> touching the Crown, was decided. And, I pray you, how could theſe things have been, unleſſe the Parliament had been above the King?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inſt. 4.</hi> But (<hi>ſaith Salmaſius</hi>) the power of convocating, and diſſolving the Parliament, belongeth to the King of <hi>England.</hi> The power of the Parliament is extraordinary, and <hi>pro-tune.</hi> But the power of the King is ordinary and perpetual. And likewiſe, the King of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, hath a negative voice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in many Acts of Parliament, he is called the King and Lord of the Parliament, and what is ordained, is enacted in his Name. And ſo (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) though the King of <hi>England</hi> doth act according to the Laws of the Kingdom, and concurrence of his Parliament, yet notwithstanding, he is an abſolute King. Otherwiſe the Kings of the <hi>Jews</hi> had not been abſolute, who had power to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the Sanhedrin. And <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had not been abſolute, who could not be reconciled to <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> becauſe the Law
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114526:50"/>
diſcharged it. Yea, if Kings were not abſolute, becauſe they act according to the Law, and the advice of their Parliament; then <hi>Cambyſes</hi> had not been abſolute; who conveened a Councel, while<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he intended to marry his german ſiſter, and demanded of them, if there was any ſuch law for allowing ſuch a marriage. <hi>Def.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Salmaſius</hi> ſhall do well, to conſider theſe few things. 1. What the power of the <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> is. Which is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Camdenus,</hi> to be made-up of three Eſtates, having the higheſt and moſt ſovereign power in making Laws, confirming Laws, annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Laws, interpreting Laws, and in doing every thing wherein the good of the Commonwealth is concerned. <hi>Brit. chorog. de Tribun. Ang.</hi> This is far from <hi>Salmaſius</hi> mind, who (<hi>Def. Reg. cap. 9.</hi>) opinionateth, that the Parliament hath not power over every thing in the Kingdom. But <hi>Polydore</hi> ſummeth-up the power of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament under theſe notions. Firſt, Every thing wherein the good of the Commonwealth is intereſted, is referred to it. Secondly, Whatſoever is done at the command, whether of King or People, is of none effect, unleſs it be authorized by the Parliament. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It eſtabliſheth and taketh away Laws, as it judgeth fit. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Every Member of it hath a-like power and freedom in voicing. And what is decreed and enacted by Parliament, he calleth it, the proper and municipal Law of the Kingdom. Seing then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is the moſt ſovereign and ſupream power in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> according as it was in old; how can it be ſaid, That the King of <hi>England</hi> hath power over it? If it be ſo, then you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit two Supream powers, and a power above a Supream power; which is contradicent. The <hi>Lacedemonian Ephori</hi> were no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe above their Kings, but becauſe they were inveſted with the higheſt and ſupream power. All things were referred to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, even as the <hi>Roman Conſuls,</hi> as <hi>Feſtus</hi> (out of <hi>Coelidus</hi>) ſaith, did refer every thing to the Senate. Now, becauſe of this, the Senate had the higheſt power, and was above the Conſuls. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> ſeing all matters of the Commonwealth in old, in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> were referred to the Parliament, no queſtion it had power above the King. The <hi>Roman Senate</hi> is therefore ſaid, to have been of the ſupreameſt power, <hi>Feneſt. de Magiſtrat. Rom. cap.</hi> 1. becauſe neither Kings, nor Conſuls, nor Dictators,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114526:51"/>
nor any other Magiſtrate, could do any thing without their advice and counſel. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſeing whatſoever the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or any other of that Kingdom, did in old, was to no purpoſe, without the authority and approbation of Parliament, without all controverſie the King of <hi>England</hi> was ſubjected to the Parliament. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> concludeth the King to be above the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he alledgeth, the Parliament can do nothing without the King. Why may not I then conclude, the Parliament to be above the King, becauſe <hi>re ipſa,</hi> and according to the Law of the Kingdom, the King can do nothing without the authority and conſent of the Parliament? Where then, I pray you, is the King's negative voice? There is not a Member in Parliament, <hi>cui oequa loquendi poteſias non competit.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Polyd. Angl. hiſt. lib.</hi> 11. What? Do you imagine, that ever the Parliament could by their authority have drawen-up the foreſaid agreement, between <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> 2. unleſſe they had had power above the King? What they did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, was a direct acting both over <hi>Steven</hi> their preſent King, and <hi>Henry</hi> 2. their future King. But, will you tell me, whileas the States of <hi>England</hi> did ſeek of <hi>K. John,</hi> to be governed by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lawes made by <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour, whether or not were theſe Lawes Acts of meet pleaſure, giving the King a liberty to do as he would, either to tyrannize over the people, or not? You can not hold the affirmative, becauſe what they demanded of the King, was to be reſtored to liberty &amp; to be freed of tyranny. <hi>Polyd. Vir. Angl. hiſt. lib.</hi> 15. And if you hold the negative part, then do the ancient Laws of <hi>England</hi> pull abſoluteneſſe out of the king's hands, and ſubject him to Law. <hi>Magna charta</hi> ſaith, <hi>The King can do nothing but by Lawes, and no obedience is due to him but by Law.</hi> And the States of <hi>England</hi> were ſo far from permitting <hi>John</hi> to rule at randome, and not according to the ancient Lawes of the kingdom, that contrarywiſe they combined againſt him, entering in oath together, to purſue him ſtill on, till he ſhould govern according to Law, and eſtabliſh the ancient Lawes of the kingdom. Yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> commanded them to lay-down arms, and though upon their deniall thereof, they were declared enemies by the Pope, they notwithſtanding followed-on their purpoſe, and cryed-out, that they would be avenged by fire and ſword, on ſuch a wicked tyrant, who did ſo much ſlight the people. Aye, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114526:51"/>
is more, they ſent into <hi>France,</hi> and from thence brought <hi>Ludovick</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king's ſon, and created him king, notwithſtanding any thing either <hi>John</hi> or the Pope could do in the contrary. Thus they never reſted, till in ſorrow they brought <hi>John</hi>'s head into the grave. Where I pray you is the abſoluteneſſe of the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whenas the States would not ſuffer him to govern but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, and in denying to do ſo, purſued him in arms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinging him, enkinging another in his room, and bringing himſelf in ſorrow to the grave? This is far from the arbitrary and infinite power of kings, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſpeaketh of. And whereas he ſaith, the parliament is but extraordinary and <hi>pro tunc,</hi> this is, either becauſe Kings were long before Parliaments; or becauſe the Parliament hath not power to intermeddle in every buſineſſe of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but is conveened <hi>pro re nata,</hi> for ordering the weightieſt Affairs of the kingdom. If you ſay the former, we do not deny it. We heartily confeſſe, that of all Governments, Monarchy was firſt eſtabliſhed. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> giveth the reaſon of it, becauſe (ſaith he) in the beginning it was hard to find-out many men, fit and able to govern. And therefore neceſſity moved them to lay the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on one: for though in the beginning it was hard to finde-out many, yet was it eaſie to finde-out one endowed with qualities and gifts for governing. <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. But though this be granted, yet doth it not follow, but Senats, or Parliaments being eſtabliſhed, they have (even according to the cuſtome of the Nations) more power then kings, as is ſhewed already. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in the places fore-cited, that by proceſſe of time, the number of Common-wealth's-men increaſing, kings at laſt went cloſe out of requeſt, and were denuded of all power. And <hi>Pol.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. he ſaith, that in after-times the power of kings was extremely leſſened, partly becauſe of their own voluntary demit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and partly becauſe of the people's detracting from their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Nay, any king <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alloweth, he alloweth no more power and greatneſſe to him, but to be greater and more powerful then every one <hi>ſeparatim,</hi> and many <hi>conjunctim,</hi> but to be of leſſe power and greatneſſe then the peoople. <hi>Pol.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. But I pray you, what is the Parliament, but the Repreſentative of the people? If you ſay the other, we deny it, as is ſhewed already. And it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very ſtrange to me, that the Parliament hath not power in ſmall
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114526:52"/>
matters, and yet hath power to manage and go about matters of higheſt concernment. If <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will ask Philoſophs, they can tell him, <hi>Qui poteſt majus, poteſt minus.</hi> He imagineth that he gaineth the point, becauſe the King of <hi>England</hi> had power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen and diſſolve the Parliament, as he judged fit. This is but a ſinging of the triumph before the victory: for the <hi>Roman Conſuls</hi> had the ſame power over the Senat. <hi>Alex. ab Alex. gen. di. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. But who will ſay, that they had an abſolute power over the Senat, though they had power of convocating and diſſolving it? It is not unknown, that their power notwithſtanding, was a non-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and limited power. <hi>Alex. ab Al. ibid. Pompon. Let. de mag. Rom. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Feneſt. de mag. Rom. cap.</hi> 7. So ſay <hi>Feſtus</hi> and <hi>Coelidus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. What honour is given to the King. And if <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will conſider this aright, he will find that there is a vaſt diſproportion between his honour and his power, and that there is more given to him in word then in deed. The King of <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> or any other, an abſolute Prince. This afterward ſhall moſt evidently appear. And yet in many Acts of Parliament he is called the Parliament's Sovereign Lord and King, and what is enacted in Parliament, ordinarily it is expreſſed under the King's name. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> imagineth, that this maketh much for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whileas it is ſaid, <hi>Dominus noſter Rex, ad petitionem ſuorum proelatorum, comitum, &amp; baronum congregatorum in Parlamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, conſtituit certos articulos.

But <hi>Parl.</hi> 5. <hi>act.</hi> 81. the King withall getteth a very lordly ſtile. <hi>Item the ſaid day, our ſovereigne Lord the King, with conſent of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114526:52"/>
whole Parliament, ordained.</hi> The <hi>Scotiſh parliamentary acts</hi> are full to this purpoſe. But can any therefore conclude, that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> is an abſolute Prince? No verily. Kings get ſuch honour, and every thing for the moſt part is enacted and emitted in their name, not becauſe they have power and dignity above the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but becauſe they are the higheſt and chiefeſt Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And let me tell you, people are ſo much deluded with the greatneſſe of the King, that they cannot give him onely that which is his due, but they aſcribe that which is due both to him and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to him alone. People know better how to idolize Kings, then how to honour them. Yea, people are more ready to obey the King, then the Parliament: And therefore I think, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that will have Kings for effectuating their purpoſes, do wife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to emit Acts in the King's name, and ſet him a-work to execute them. Therefore <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſhall not need to boaſt with this, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is called, the Parliament's Sovereigne Lord; and the Parliament, the Councell of the King. The like he will find more then once amongſt the Prefaces and Acts of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Parliaments.</hi> Yet he, or any for him, can never prove, that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> is an abſolute King. He ſhall therefore do well, (left he confound things which ſhould be divided) to diſtinguiſh carefully between that which the king hath <hi>re tenus,</hi> and what is given to him but <hi>nomine tenus.</hi> And ſo he will find, that though the king of <hi>England</hi> hath as much <hi>nomine tenus,</hi> as if he were an abſolute Prince, yet <hi>re tenus</hi> he is ſubjected to Law.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he alledgeth, kings may governe by advice and counſell of Parliament, and yet may be abſolute, and have a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice, the like ſay I too. But he ſhall give me leave to ſay, that ſuch have not ſuch a vaſt power as he talketh-of, as afterward is ſhewed. I confeſſe, the examples of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> and <hi>Cambyſes</hi> are to the purpoſe, though the man fail a-little concerning the <hi>jus</hi> of the kings of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as afterward is ſhewed. Howſoever, though I grant this, yet ſhall he never prove, that the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> according to the Law of the kingdom, is an abſolute Prince, and hath a negative voice in Parliament. He can never ſhew me, that the king of <hi>England</hi> had the ſame power which the king of <hi>Perſia</hi> had.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I admire that this man knoweth nothing, but to rail on them whom he knoweth not. Well, I caſt him over into GOD'S hands, and fall to examine what he alledgeth. Sure I am, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his railing, it cannot abide the touch-ſtone. It is known to be a manifeſt lie which he alledgeth, concerning the immediat ſucceſſours of the Conquerour. It is reported in even-down terms, that theſe kings (of whom <hi>Salmaſius</hi> expreſly ſpeaketh) eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Norman Laws</hi> eſtabliſhed by the Conquerour, too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unjuſt. And therefore, before they got the Crown, they promiſed to the people to abrogate them, and in place of them, to eſtabliſh the Laws of the Confeſſour. Yea, every-one of them promiſed more then another, and to keep themſelves within the bounds of Law, to the very heart's deſire of the people. This was not only promiſed by themſelves, but alſo by others in their name. And unleſſe they had ſo promiſed, they could never have gotten the Crown. They got it upon the expectation of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their promiſe, as the <hi>Engliſh Hiſtories</hi> do abundantly ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And it cannot be denied but <hi>Henry</hi> 1. did give the <hi>Engliſhes</hi> a free Parliament, and made it the government of the kingdom. So that he is called the firſt king in <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe time the power of Parliament was eſtabliſhed. And as for <hi>John,</hi> it is very well known, that becauſe he did not ſtand to his oath and promiſe at his Coronation, for eſtabliſhing the ancient Laws of the kingdom, but endeavoured to governe after the manner of the Conquerour, in an arbitrary and looſe way, therefore the people roſe-up in arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and dethroning him, did ſet-up another in his room. And whereas this man ſaith, that the ancient Lawes of the kingdom did not derogate from the ſupremacy and abſoluteneſſe of the king, the contrary of that is already proved. It ſeemeth ſtrange to me, that he is not aſhamed to affirm, that what Laws were eſtabliſhed by <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour, and granted by <hi>King John,</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114526:53"/>
inviolable to this day, derogating nothing from the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>John</hi>'s ſucceſſours. Who knoweth not, that the liberties of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>de Foreſta</hi> ſubject the King to Law? And becauſe that <hi>Henry</hi> 3. did not ſtand to the maintenance thereof, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given his Oath at a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to maintain them inviolable, therefore the People took up Arms againſt him, till after many debates between them, they cauſed him often to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they ſhould be inviolably obſerved, as well by him, as by all other. Thus they tied, not only him, but alſo his heirs, to govern according to the ancient Laws of the Kingdom. And becauſe <hi>Edward</hi> 2. did act againſt theſe Laws, following the counſel of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gaveſton,</hi> and the two <hi>Spenſers,</hi> therefore he was impriſoned and dethroned, after ſeveral conſlicts between him and the People? 'Tis remarkable, that the People refuſed to crown him, till firſtly he did put <hi>P. Gaveſton</hi> from him. And likewiſe <hi>Edward</hi> 5. was depoſed, after he had reigned two moneths and eleven dayes, and was obſcurely buried in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> Where then, I pray you, is the abſoluteneſs of the King of <hi>England?</hi>

                     <hi>Inſt. 6.</hi> Under <hi>Edward 4. (ſaith Salmaſius)</hi> it was enacted, That the King might erect a publick Judgment-ſeat, by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patent, in any part of the kingdom he would. Under <hi>Henry 7.</hi> it was enacted and declared, That the King had a full power in all Cauſes, in adminiſtring Juſtice to every one. In the firſt year of <hi>Edward 6.</hi> a Statute was made, declaring, all authority, both Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, to be derived from the King. <hi>Def. Reg. cap. 9.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt needs ſay, This hath more colour of probation, then any thing the man as yet hath objected. But not withſtanding this he will do well to obſerve this diſtinction. 1. What is given to the King by way of complement and Court-expreſſion. 2. What is giving to him in reality and by way of action. The truth is, in the firſt notion there is as much aſcribed to the King of <hi>England,</hi> as if he had been indeed an abſolute Prince. On him you have theſe Court-Epithets, <hi>The King of the Parliament, The ſovereign Lord of the Parliament.</hi> Yea, and the Parliament is called, <hi>The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King.</hi> He is called, <hi>The Original both of Spirituall and Temporal power; having full power over all cauſes and perſons, and to crect Judicatories in any part of the kingdom, where he</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114526:54"/>
                     <hi>pleaſeth.</hi> This is ſpoken. But what then? Examine the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and you will find it but ſpoken. What? cannot Court-Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, and flattering Councellors paſſe a fair compellation upon their Prince? 'Tis the leaſt thing they can do, to bring themſelves in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with him. Read the Parliamentary Acts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and you will find juſt as much ſpoken, if not more, of the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> In <hi>Parl.</hi> 18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>James</hi> 6. is called, <hi>Sovereign Monarch, abſolute Prince, Judge and Governour over all Eſtates, Perſons, and Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But according to the ſecond notion, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſtrength of theſe Epithets. And ſo in the firſt place we fall a-diſcuſſing particularly theſe three Sanctions, of which <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſpeaketh. The firſt faith, That the King by his Letters patent may erect Court-Judicatories in any part of the Kingdom, where he pleaſeth. This will never conclude, that the King of <hi>England</hi> hath an abſolute power. This Act only ſpeaketh of his power of calling inferiour Judicatories. What is that to the purpoſe? The King of <hi>England</hi> had power to call, and diſſolve the Parliament, the higheſt Judicatory of the Land. Yea, <hi>Henry</hi> 1. did ordain and conſtitute the Parliament. Yet notwithſtanding that, (as is ſhewed already) the King of <hi>England</hi> cannot be called abſolute. The King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath power of giving-out Letters of Caption. <hi>Parl. Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. Courts of Regalities are juſtified by the King's Juſtice, <hi>chap.</hi> 26. And the Parliament petitioned the King to cauſe execute the Act anent the Eſtabliſhment of Seſſions, for executing Juſtice, <hi>chap.</hi> 65. The power of the Colledge of Juſtice is ratified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the King. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. <hi>Parl. Edinb. Mar.</hi> 17.1532. But who will therefore call the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> an abſolute King? The ſecond Sanction giveth the King full power over all perſons, and all cauſes. But I pray you, doth this give the King power over the Parliament and Laws? No verily. It only giveth the King power over all perſons and eſtates, <hi>ſeparatim,</hi> but not <hi>conjunctim,</hi> as conveened in parliament. Which cometh juſt to that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> faith, alledging, that the King hath power over all, <hi>ſeorſim,</hi> but not <hi>conjunctim. Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. And he is ſaid, to have a full power, not becauſe his power is abſolute and boundleſſe. Verily, it muſt not be taken in a ſimple and abſolute notion, but in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114526:54"/>
and comparative ſenſe. It doth not imply the exemption and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the King, from Civill and Politick ſubjection to Law: But at the moſt it pleadeth for exemption to him from forraine power, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to forrain laws. This is evident by comparing this ſanction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Henry</hi> 7. with <hi>ſtat.</hi> 18. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. Where it is declared that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is free without ſubjection to any other Crown, but is onely ſubject immediatly to GOD, in every thing which relateth to the managing of it's Affairs. The like is ſpoken <hi>Henry</hi> 8. <hi>Par.</hi> 24. So we find the like fulneſſe of power pleaded-for to the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> ITEM <hi>It is thought expedient, that ſince our Soveraign Lord hath full juriſdiction, and free empire within his Realm, that his Highneſſe may make Notares,and in time to-come, that no Notare made nor to be made by the Emperour's authority have faith in Contracts Civill, unleſſe he beapproved by the King's highneſſe. Jam. 3. parl. ch. 38.</hi> This exemption is pleaded for to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> from ſubjection to the Imperiall Lawes. But who, I pray you, for this will conclude the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Prince, having immunity and freedome from all Lawes, whether muncipall and Country-Lawes, or ſorenſick and forrain? And as for the third ſanction, the words whereof be theſe, <hi>Omnem authoritatem ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualem &amp; temporalem derivari a Rege,</hi> you ſhall be pleaſed concerning it to obſerve this diſtinction. There be two termes in the act it-ſelf, one concerning temporall and another concerning ſpirituall power. We begin at temporall power. The King may be called the originall of it two wayes. 1. <hi>Formally, i.e.</hi> as if all temporall power were therefore authoritative and juridicall, becauſe of the Kingly power, it being only in it-ſelf effentially authoritative and commanding. This we deny to be the ſenſe of the ſanction, in reſpect of temporall power. It is not onely repugnant to <hi>Magnacharta,</hi> the ancient Lawes of the Kingdom, the nature of Parliaments appointed and ordained in <hi>Henry</hi> 1. his time, to the oaths and promiſes of <hi>Rufus, Henry</hi> 1. &amp; their ſucceſſoursto act and govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, but alſo to the ordinary practices of the Eſtates, who in maintenance of their Liberties and the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, did riſe in armes againſt their Kings, and cauſed them nilled they, willed they, to ſubject their necks to the yokes of Law. Amongſt other of their practices this is very remarkable, that albeit they had ſaluted <hi>Ludovick</hi> as their King, and put him in the room of <hi>John,</hi> yet notwithſtanding in the end they declined him, and in his ſtead crowned <hi>Henry</hi> 3. <hi>John</hi>'s ſon. This ſpeaketh much of the States power above the King. 2. <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> It cannot be denied but in this notion all temporall power depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the King. And that two wayes, <hi>effectively,</hi> and <hi>vindicatively. Effectively,</hi> becauſe the King of <hi>England</hi> had not onely power of convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; diſſolving the Parliament &amp; of ordaining inferior Judicatories, but alſo by him the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was firſtly inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114526:55"/>
                     <hi>Vindicatively,</hi> becauſe it was his part to patronize and execute the acts of Parliament, at leaſt as the main and prime man of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and defending them. The like power the Kings of <hi>Scotlana</hi> had alſo as is clear from their Acts of Parliament. But as for the ſpirituall power of the King of <hi>England,</hi> I ſtand not much to confeſſe that he had a formall and Ecclefiaſtick power in Church-matters, and that what power the Church (ſo called) had was derived from him. It cannot be denied, but before the conqueſt there were Eccleſiaſticall Laws made by many Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Inas, Alfred, Edward</hi> the elder, <hi>Gythrum, Ethelſtane, Edmund, Edgar, Aetheldred, Canutus</hi> and others. In the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim</hi> this Gentleman ſhall do well to obſerve, that the King of <hi>England</hi> had not alwayes this power. It cannot be denied but <hi>Lanfrancus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmus,</hi> and <hi>Berket</hi> going to complain on their Kings and Governours, firſtly brought the Pope's judiciall authority from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> both over King and people. Which ſupremacy of the Pope over the Church of <hi>England</hi> untill in and about <hi>Henry</hi> 8. his dayes, who did ſhake-off the Pope's yoke, did continue. And ſo <hi>Edward</hi> 6. ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; to me it is more then probable that by the ſcreſaid ſanction made in his time, the ancient power of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters was taken out of the Pope's hands, and put upon the King. And it cannot be denied, but according to <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſour's Lawes, the King of <hi>England</hi> had a primary formall and Eccleſiaſtick power in Church-matters. I ſtand not to grant that. But what though I ſhould ſay, that according to this ſtatute made in <hi>Edward</hi> 6. his time, the King of <hi>England</hi> had a primary and originall power, and that <hi>formally,</hi> both in reſpect of ſpirituall and temporall juriſdiction; yet will it onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an abſoluteneſſe of the King according to Law, but not againſt it. It no wayes denudeth the people of a fountain-power, to deſend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the unjuſt decrees and actings of the King. The <hi>Roman dictatour</hi> had an abſolute power in judging, and yet it was lawfull for the people to repeal his acts in their own juſt defence. Many times have the People of <hi>England</hi> defended themſelves from their King and ſtood by their own liberties; notwithſtanding the King's acting againſt them. What, I pray you, is it for me to ſay that the King of <hi>England</hi> by this act is called the originall both of ſpirituall and temporall power, under a formall notion? Is he not called alſo the King and Sovereign Ford of the Parliament? Is not the Parliament called his Parliament? Is not every thing ordinarily acted and emitted under his name? Is it not ordinarily ſaid, <hi>It is ordained by the King With the eonſent, or at the deſire of the three Eſtates?</hi> It is very ſeldome ſaid, <hi>It is ordained by the King and Parliament.</hi> But, I pray you, what be theſe but Court-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements? They are words, and nothing but words. Go, conſer them with the practice of the Parliament, and you ſhall finde the one juſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114526:55"/>
contrary to the other. No wonder forſooth, becauſe the King getteth more honour then he hath power. Trie this, and you will find it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary practice. Aye, which is more, cannot a corrupt Parliament through the defection of the times give the King more then what is due to him, either by the Law of GOD, or by the law of the Nation? Know we not that <hi>Parl.</hi> 18. <hi>K. Jam.</hi> 6. through the backſliding of the times did advance him to greater priviledges then the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Law of the Kingdome had, or can be warranted by the Law of GOD? Indeed, I will not ſay ſo of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. for it is known that in his young years he did put the managing of the Kingdom into the hands of the Princes, as did others of his predeceſſors before him. And as for <hi>Edward 6.</hi> I muſt needs ſay, his times were better then any times of his predeceſſors. But it appeareth to me, that as both <hi>Henry</hi> and he have encroached very far upon the liberties of the Church (ſo called) ſo did they encroach too far upon the liberties of the State. But leaving <hi>Henry,</hi> of whoſe power I find not ſo much ſpoken as of <hi>Edward,</hi> I muſt tell you one thing concerning <hi>Edward,</hi> and it is this. Thoſe who write of him, and namely <hi>Foxe,</hi> do crie him up beyond all the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for piety, wiſdom and learning. And <hi>Foxe</hi> runneth ſo far out in his commendation, that he eſteemeth him inferiour to no King, though worthy to be preferred to many. Whereupon he feareth not to match him with <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and put the qualifications of both in one ballance. Which maketh me imagine that the foreſaid act emitted in Parliament under <hi>Edward</hi>'s reign, did paſſe in his behalfe, becauſe of his perſonall endowments. The like act upon that ſame ground, (though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of him it was meerly pretended, without any reality in his perſon) did paſſe <hi>Parl.</hi> 18. upon <hi>K. Iam.</hi> 6. Thus the caſe is extraordinary We den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſtanding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lawes both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are againſt abſolute Princes. Of <hi>scotland</hi> and of <hi>England</hi> we have ſpoken already at length. Verily the example of <hi>Edward</hi> 1. though there were no more, may ſerve to clear o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(who was at variance with the people touching the liberties of <hi>Magna charta,</hi> and <hi>de foreſta</hi>) did much gratifie the people; reſtoring them to great liberty, and abrogating all lawes which did make for the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlavery of the people. Howſoever the matter be <hi>five ſic, five non,</hi> theſe ſanctions above-cited by <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> do conclude the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have power above the King. The reaſon is, becauſe if we look preciſely on theſe acts, what power the King hath is from them. They not onely declare, but alſo they enact and ratifie his power to be ſuch
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114526:56"/>
ſuch. And ſo the king's power is the creature of the Parliament, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from it, as the effect from the cauſe. But ſure I am, <hi>cauſe eſt nobilior ſuo effectu,</hi> And conſequently, if the king hath an abſolute power, by vertue of the Parliament, then muſt the Parliament's power be more abſolute; for <hi>prepter quod unumquodque eſt tale, illud ipſum eſt magis tale.</hi> And <hi>nemo dat qnod non habet.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſtand not to gloſſe <hi>Bracton</hi>'s words. He lived in <hi>Henry</hi> 3. his dayes. And finding the King and States at variance about ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as a Court-parafit, he wrote in behalf of the King, as Royalliſts do now-a-dayes. He did juſt ſo as they do now <hi>Bracton</hi> had that ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of writing in behalf of the King, which <hi>Salmaſius</hi> hath to-day. As the late King was at variance with the people of <hi>England,</hi> for claiming abſolute power over them; ſo the controverſie ſtood juſt ſo in <hi>Bracton</hi>'s time between <hi>Henry</hi> 3. and the people. But I pray you was it not as free to <hi>Bracton</hi> to flatter <hi>Henry,</hi> as for <hi>salmaſius</hi> to flatter <hi>Charles?</hi> Leaving this man to himſelf, I haſten to examinet he ſtrength of theſe Acts which <hi>Salmaſius</hi> citeth. And in a word, they do not plead ſo much for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe of the king, as of the kingdom. They do not ſpeak <hi>de Rege Angliae,</hi> of the king of <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>de corona,</hi> or <hi>Regno Angliae,</hi> of the Crown or kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Howſoever, none of them doth ſpeak for immunity and exemption to the king of <hi>England,</hi> from municipall, but from forraign Laws: And therefore they declare the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to be a free Crown, and ſubject to no other Crown; and the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be a free kingdom, ſubject to the Laws of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdom. I confeſſe, they declare the king to be above the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and inferiour to none but to GOD. Which is true indeed, taking the kingdom in <hi>eſſe diviſivo</hi> but not in <hi>eſſe conjunctivo.</hi> Indeed, the King is above all in the kingdom <hi>ſigillatim,</hi> one by one And in this reſpect he is inferiour to none but to GOD, though taking the kingdom in a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective body, he be inferiour thereto.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for that concerning <hi>James,</hi> we make no reckoning of it: He was declared the righteous and undoubted heir of the kingdom through the defection and back-ſliding of the times. What other Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hinted at before, that he did execute. Becauſe he became King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and entered the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> upon blood relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore ſlattering, Malignant and Antichriſtian Counſellours did declare his title to the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be of undoubted heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right. I pray you, friend, were there not Malignants then, as well as now? I may ſay, there were moe then, then now, at leaſt they had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority then what Malignants have now a-dayes. And tell me, do not Malignants at this day make uſe of the King's pretended great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and hereditary right to the Crown of <hi>Britain,</hi> for cloaking their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and effectuating their malignant purpoſes? Do not you imagine, but Papiſts and Malignants in <hi>England</hi> had that ſame reaſon for them, to make uſe of <hi>K. Jame</hi>'s power? What I pray you, is the over-word of Papiſts and Malignants in <hi>Britain</hi> to-day? The King (ſay they) is the undoubted heir of the kingdom, and abſolute in power: Who then ſhould riſe againſt him? This is even the moſt they have to cloak their knavery, and to caſt a luſtre upon their Antichriſtian and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant endeavours. Do you imagine that the devill was ſleeping in <hi>K. James</hi> time? No verily. And there hath nothing been done theſe twelve or thirteen years by-gone, whether againſt State or Church, but what was moulded then. The very plat-form of all was caſt in his dayes, By the <hi>Scotiſh Parliament</hi> his power was declared abſolute: And by the <hi>Engliſh Parliament,</hi> his right to the Crown of <hi>Englana</hi> was declared undoubted and hereditary. They ſtood not to ſwear obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him and his poſterity into all ages. And how far on he drew the power of Epiſcopacy, and how much he acted for intruding the Maſſe Book upon the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is more then known. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wits, and many Pens, in his dayes were imployed for carrying-on and effectuating malignant &amp; antichriſtian deſignments. <hi>Sal.</hi> is a child to object from the practice of the <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> in <hi>K. James</hi> time. He may as well object for evincing his purpoſe, from the practice of the Parliament holden at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by <hi>Charles.</hi> And if he doth either of them he doth nothing but beggeth the queſtion. He telleth us that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114526:57"/>
of <hi>England K. James an.</hi> 1. declared and enacted his right to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be undoubted &amp; hereditary. Well, I can tell him that <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, the <hi>Normane-Lawgiver,</hi> doth denie to the King of <hi>England</hi> any ſuch title or claim to the Crown <hi>Diaaema regale</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quod nullus auteceſſorum meorum geſſit, adeptus ſum, quod divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſolummodo gratia, non jus contulit haeriditarium,Nemincm Anglici regni conſtituo haeredem, ſed aeterno conditori, cujus ſum, &amp; in cujus manu ſunt omnia, illud commendo; non enim tantum decus baeriditario jure poſſedi, ſed diro inſiictu, &amp; multa effuſione ſanguinis humani, perjuro Regi Haraldo abſtuli, &amp; interfectis, belfugatis fautoribus ejus dominatui meo ſubegi Camd. Brit. chorogr. deſer.</hi> which he citeth out of <hi>hiſt. de monaſt. Steph. Cadom. in Norm. i. e.</hi> I have acquired the Royall Crown, which none of my anceſtours did bear, which the grace of GOD alone, and not heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right beſtowed upon me,I conſtitute no heir of the <hi>Engliſh Kingdom,</hi> but I recommend it to the eternall Creator, whoſe I am and in whoſe hands are all things: for I did not enjoy ſuch a honour by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right, but by dire conflicts, and great effuſion of mans blood I took it from the perjured King <hi>Harald,</hi> and ſubjected it to my dominion, having killed or put to flight his favourers. Thus <hi>Salmaſius</hi> may ſee that he buildeth hereditary right to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> upon a ſandy foundation, in pleading for the undoubtednes thereof from what right the Conquerour had over it. Let it be ſo, the Conquerour himſelf had right to it by the ſword, yet in his fore-going latter-wil he ſhaketh all his ſucceſtors looſe of any right to it by ſucceſſion, and caſteth the diſpoſition thereof wholly over upon GOD and the people. Whence was it, that (as is ſaid already) the people did create <hi>Rufus</hi> king in his room and paſſed-by <hi>Robert</hi> his eldeſt ſon. 'Tis remarkable, that no where it can be read that the Conquerour did tie the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Salmaſius cap.</hi> 8. maketh a faſhion of proving it out of <hi>Malmsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſis, Hundingtonionſis,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh hiſtortans:</hi> who ſay nothing but that the Conquerour ſubdued <hi>England,</hi> and cauſed the people ſwear allegeance and ſidelity to himſelf. No other thing can be read in them. And no-where can <hi>salmaſius</hi> find it, that ever he did tie the people of <hi>England</hi> by bath, both to himſelf and his poſterity. Neither dar <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> conclude any thing from theſe Hiſtorians, directly. He concludeth that but by the way, becauſe of the Conquerour's full and abſolute ſubjecting of <hi>England</hi> to himſelf, as indeed theſe Hiſtorians do report. Yet friend, this is but a ſtollen dint. You loſe more then you gain by it.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Camden</hi> he cannot be of <hi>Salmaſius</hi> judgement, unleſſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf. From him we have ſaid already, that the power of the Parliament is above the King. Therefore whileas he faith that the King of <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>ſupremam poteſtatem, &amp; merum imperium,</hi> it cannot be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114526:57"/>
underſtood of the kingdom taken in a collective body. And it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, taking the people <hi>ſigillatim,</hi> one by one, the King of <hi>England</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all, and interiour to none, but to GOD. And in this ſenſe he ſpeaketh well, <hi>nec praeter Deum ſuperiorem agnoſcit.</hi> In this ſenſe the latter part of <hi>Cokius</hi> words is to purpoſe. Becauſe of this ſuperiority the 24. <hi>Parl. Henr.</hi> 8. paſſeth a fair complement upon him, ſaying, that the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> doth acknowledge none ſuperiour to it under GOD but his majeſty, and that it is governed by no Laws, but what were made within it-ſelf by the tolerance of him, and his progenitors.<hi>Per tolerantiam tuce gratiae &amp; tuorum progenitorum,Misalmaſi</hi> it had been more for thy purpoſe, if they had ſaid, <hi>Per authoritatom tuae gratiae, &amp; tuorum progenitorum.</hi> This ſoundeth no ordinative and effective, but permiſſive and approbative power in the King. Well, let this paſſe, the former part of <hi>Coktus</hi> words doth not ſpeak of the abſoluteneſte of the King, but of the kingdom of <hi>England. Juxa tgitur lages bajus regni anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hoc Angliae regnum abſolutum eſt imperium,De jur.

                  <p>We come now in the next room to demonſtrate the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the Law of the Nation, to be a regulated and non-abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince. This is ſo clear, that we need not to ſpeak any thing of it. And it is ſo abundantly proved by our godly 81 dear Country-man, <hi>Lex Rex, quaeſt.</hi> 43. that no man in it can go beyond him. Therefore we ſhall only glance at it by comparing in ſome few particulars the <hi>Lacedemonian kingdome</hi> with the <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> in ſubjecting their Kings to Law. 1.

Whence the kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> had no power to do any thing without the advice and counſel of the Eſtates. They had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to eſtabliſh or abrogate laws, according to their pleaſure. This my dear Country-man proveth at length in the place above-cited.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114526:58"/>
and governours, ſhould not make or break war, peace or leagues. 2. As the <hi>Lacedemonian king</hi> did bind himſelf by oath to govern according to the <hi>I</hi> awes of the kingdom, <hi>Xenoph. de Repub. Laced. &amp;. N. Damaſc. de mor. gent. Laced.</hi> ſo the king of <hi>Scots</hi> by Oath and Covenant is tied to do the like. The plat-form of the king's coronation-oath is ſet-down, <hi>K. James 6. Parl.</hi> 1. Whereby he is obliged, <hi>to maintain the true Kirk of GOD, and Religion now preſently profeſſed in purity, and to rule the people according to the laws, and conſtitutions received in the Realm, cauſing juſtice and equity to be miniſtred without partiality.</hi> This did both <hi>James</hi> 6. and <hi>Charles</hi> ſwear. And that this is no new cuſtome amongſt the kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> you will find it more then abundantly proved by our learned Country-man in the place above-quoted. 3. The <hi>Lacedemonian kings</hi> were ſubjected to the ſtroke of juſtice. Which maketh <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſo to write of them, <gap reason="foreign">

And with them did ſit the Ephorick magiſtracy, together with the King of the other family. So the king of <hi>Scots</hi> was cenſured by the Parliament, made up of three Eſtates. His neck was brought under their yoke, as my learned Country-man maketh good in the place fore-quoted. And ſo, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did cut-off, and turn-out many kings, (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Pol.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) ſo the <hi>Scots</hi> in old did the like, as is made good already. See <hi>Lex Rex, loc. cit.</hi> I have read much of the non-abſoluteneſſe of the <hi>Athenian, Cretian, Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian kings, &amp;c.</hi> But I may juſtly ſay, that no kingdom in the world (as I can learn from hiſtory) hath exerciſed Law more, or ſo much on their kings, as the <hi>Scots</hi> have done. There is indeed a ſtrange change in Court amongſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> if we compare the latter times with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For my ſelf, I obſerve GOD's ſpeciall providence in it, who wil have the practices of the ancient <hi>Scots</hi> much to condemn and plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the endeavours and practices of the <hi>latter Scots</hi> to day. Yea, the ancient <hi>Scots</hi> even in this do go beyond the <hi>Lacedemonians, viz.</hi> the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian king</hi> was hereditary. But till <hi>Kenneth</hi> 3. the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> king was elective, though for favour of the <hi>Ferguſian race,</hi> thoſe who came of <hi>Fergus</hi> were created kings. See <hi>Lex Rex, ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It remaineth now that we make good the concluſion it-ſelf, from the examples of kings in the ſecond notion, <hi>i. e.</hi> of thoſe kings whoſe power was one way or other limited, though for the moſt part abſolute. In this we will obſerve <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> method. He brancheth-forth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy into four ſpecies. The firſt he calleth <hi>Laconick,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114526:58"/>
branch of Royall Government. Of this we have ſpoken already at very great length. The ſecond kind he calleth <hi>herill</hi> and <hi>deſpotick.</hi> Such kind of Monarchy (ſaith he) was in <hi>Aſia.</hi> And albeit he ſaith, that under ſuch kind of Royall power, the people lived as ſlaves and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet withall he telleth us, that the government was carried-on and adminiſtred according to the Laws of the kingdom. We ſtand here a-litle, to illuſtrate this by example. <hi>v. g.</hi> The <hi>Median King</hi> had an abſolute power over the <hi>Medes.</hi> Any thing the Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> decreed and enacted, was unalterable. Becauſe of the vaſtneſs of their power, the wicked Preſidents obtained a Decree from <hi>Darius,</hi> That none ſhould make prayer to any ſave to the King, for fourty dayes. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Darius</hi> had not power to recall his Decree after it was made, albeit he laboured till the going-down of the Sun to revoke it. <hi>Ibid.</hi> The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was an abſolute Prince, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. <hi>Dan. 6. Herod. lib.</hi> 3. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>Abaſuerus,</hi> not only in divorcing <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> did call a Councel of wiſe-men, experienced in the Laws, but alſo he ſubmitted himſelf to their determination, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. And albeit he deſired through the abundance of love he did bear to <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> to be recnociled to her, yet could he not recall the Divorcement, becauſe the Law made againſt it, <hi>Joſeph, Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. I deny not but the <hi>Perſian Kings</hi> had an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power in making Laws. Yet being made, they had not power at their own pleaſure to recall them. Their Laws were irrevocable, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. <hi>Dan. 6.</hi> And conſequently, though their power was abſolute in making Laws, yet was it limited in abrogating them. They had power to make them, though not to break them. 'Tis obſervable, that <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> a moſt wicked and tyrannous King, deſiring in marriage his german<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſter, called a Councel to conſult thereabout. Albeit he had an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, to do what he liſted, yet went he not about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>brevi manu,</hi> but ſought and followed the advice of his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours therein. And at this day there be many Kingdoms, wherein Monarchy and Regal Government is of this ſame ſtamp and tenour, as namely amongſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> The third is elective and aeſymnetick. This kind of Monarchy alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This he il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrateth by the example of the <hi>Mityleneans,</hi> who elected <hi>Pittacus</hi> to reign over them Truly, for my-ſelf I do imagine, that they did give <hi>Pittacus</hi> an uncircumſcribed power, becauſe of his perſonall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to govern as he pleaſed. Therefore they did not reſtrict him to govern according to the Law of the Kingdom, but voluntarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to Laws of his making. They did not tie him by Law to them, and in this his power was illimited and without bounds. Yet in ſo far as they conferred abſolute power upon him, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his perſonall endowments, he would undoubtedly govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law; in ſo far his power was limited and circumſcribed. See <hi>Gyraldus, de vit. Pittac,</hi> And <hi>Diog. Laer. de vit. Phil. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Pittac.</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:114526:59"/>
The like power did the <hi>Athenians</hi> alſo offer to <hi>Solon,</hi> as is above-ſaid. The fourth he referreth to Monarchy, as it was in the dayes of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes. This kind of Monarchy he calleth alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Pol.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and <hi>cap.</hi> 11. he calleth it a Regall power reſtricted in ſome things, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. and what theſe things be, he hinteth at, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. ſaying, that they had not power over the ſacrifices, which concerned the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that ſome of them were either tied by oath to the people, or by lifting-up the ſcepter, to govern according to Law. Thus it is manifeſt, that all the four kindes of Monarchy <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh-of, which were ſet up in old, one way or other are limited and ſubjected to Law. But concerning the fourth kind, which was in the dayes of the Heroes, we muſt ſtand a-litle here. Hence the queſtion ariſeth, whether or not doth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> refer this fourth ſpecies of Monarchy to the Heroes without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? We ſhall not ſtand much upon what may be <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s mind in this matter. It appeareth to us, that he is in this indefinit. I confeſſe, his words with a diſtinction may bear a good ſenſe. Yet I muſt needs ſay, that neither in this, nor in the third ſpecies, the man is clear: for, I take him to be ſumming-up all the ordinary ſpecies of Royall power. But ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he erreth, or elſe he confoundeth in the third and fourth ſpecies, both ordinary and extraordinary kindes of Royall power, together, taking them both under the ſame power and notion, And in this he erreth alſo. But that we may clear our purpoſe, the Reader ſhall mark this way of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing the ſpecies of Monarchy one from another. Generally it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ordinary and extraordinary Monarchy. In an ordinary acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is parnbaſilick, and non-pambaſilick. In this ſenſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be underſtood, as we covceive. And ſo the pambaſilick Monarchy. (<hi>i.e.</hi> which hath a power over all things) relateth to the fifth ſpecies of Royall power, which <hi>Ariſtotle, Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. ſuperaddeth to the four foreſaid ſpecies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And the non-pambaſilick (<hi>i.e.</hi> which hath not a power over all things) is relative to theſe foure ſpecies above-written. Each of them (according as both <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and example teach) is either one way or other, limited and kept within bounds. And afterward we ſhall alſo ſhew it from reaſon it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But obſerve by the way, that the third ſpecies of Monarchy in this ſenſe, cannot be illuſtrated by the example of <hi>Pittacus.</hi> What power was laid upon <hi>Pittacus</hi> as is ſhewed already, was done in an extraordinary way. Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this ſpecies, cannot confound that which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary together, and illuſtrate them both by one and the ſame example. As for the fourth ſpecies taken in this ſenſe, I do verily imagine, that his words deſerve a diſtinction. Whereupon the queſtion may be moved, whether or not doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (which he maketh the fifth ſpecies of royall government) underſtand an all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power, according to law or both according to, and againſt law? it cannot be imagined, as afterward ſhall appear, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an all-commanding power above Law. Therefore is it, that <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:114526:59"/>
10. he interlaceth the fifth ſpecies of Monarchy with the fourth. Without any clear and formall diſtinction, as he doth <hi>cap.</hi> 11. he paſſeth from the one to the other, in a continuat way, linking the one with the other. And ſo taking up the fourth and the fifth ſpecies, under a continuat notion, we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reſolve <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s meaning by this diſtinction. In the former part of the fourth ſpecies, he a verreth, That Monarchy in the dayes of the Heroes, was in ſome things reſtricted, wanting this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power. And in the latter part of it, he ſaith, that in ancient times kings had that which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Verily, the man in this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cryptick and unclear: He ſpeaketh of the dayes of the Heroes indeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly. So doth he of ancient times, But oppoſing ancient times to the days of the Heroes, they can be relative to no times, but to the golden age; which was immediately after the Deluge about 131 years. All this time, as is ſhewed already, there was not ſo much as any politick government at all. And to this Age immediately ſucceeded the time of Heroiciſme. <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and many other heroick Blades immediately after that Age, did break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth who erected kingdoms and did many valiant acts. And if we ſpeak of the ancient times before the Flood, we find alſo (as is ſhewed already) that contradiſtinguiſhing ancient times from the time of Heroiciſme, there was no kingly power ſet-up, till men of renown and heroick ſpirits did erect it about the 1556 year of the world. And all the while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which was the Golden Age before the Flood, there was no kind of Politick government at all, as is ſhewed already. So then, whether before or after the Flood; the times of the Heroes did immediatly ſucceed to the ancient times. And as in the ancient times there was no Monarchy or Regall power, ſo it was firſtly erected and ſet-up by the Heroes. Therefore you may ſee that is very hard to purge <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s meaning in this from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Yet for reſpect I bear to the man, I will put upon his words the beſt ſenſe they can bear. And ſo I ſuppoſe, that he referreth both the parts of the fourth ſpecies to the dayes of the Heroes. Now, it cannot be denied, but even amongſt Heroes of the ſecondary kind, there was difference of power, ſome being of a more intenſe, and ſome of a more remiſſe power. No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, thoſe of them who in reſpect of time were prior to others, were alſo in dignity and power, prior to them. I cannot think, but how much more Regall power was in requeſt, ſo much more the power of it was extended. Therefore was it, as is ſhewed already, that ſome kings were altogether illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and uncircumſcribed in power. But in the fore-times of Heroiciſm Monarchy was more in requeſt then in the after-times thereof. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe ordinary Heroes, who had the firſt ſtart of time, before others of that ſame kind, were of a more vaſt and intenſe power then they. As they were ſuperiour to them in time, ſo likewayes in power. In this ſenſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s words hold good, if he refer the former part of the fourth ſpecies to the after-moſt times and ultimat center of Heroiciſme, and the latter part to the prior, though not to the firſt times thereof. You cannot ſay, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114526:60"/>
the former part is relative to ordinary, and the latter part to extraordinary Heroes. It is already proved by us, <hi>Conel.</hi> 1. That extraordinary Heroes had more then <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-commanding power. They had <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an arbitrary power, to do what they liſted.

Thus he putteth a difference between <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-commanding power, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-willing power. And beſide this, even ordinary Heroes, namely the founders of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Colonies, had an abſolute power without al reſtriction, <hi>Con.</hi> 2. Where alſo is ſhewed, that Heroes in after times, as founders of after-Colonies, had an abſolute power though not ſo intenſe and uncircumſcribed as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of primary Colonies. Such indeed had power to do all things, though not to undo all things. And ſo, according to the rules of proportion, as the after-Heroes were of leſſe power then the former, ſo the laſt of them had leſſer power then any of them. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That at laſt the power of Kings became exceedingly leſſened. This was after the flower of heroiciſm was quite faded. This could not be at the firſt, but hath come on by degrees. After <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which the erectors of primary Colonies had, in-ſtepped <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: Which <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, was in ancient times <hi>i. e.</hi> in the times of the after-Heroes, in and about the dayes of the founders of the ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Colonies. And then toward the cloſe, or in and about the middle time of Heroiciſm, the Kingly power in ſome things became reſtricted, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> ſaith: And ſo he ſubjoyneth, that at laſt it became exceedingly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened. Now you ſee, that in reaſon no better conſtruction can be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this fourth ſpecies of Monarchy, aſſigned by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> And for reverence of the man's memory, I ſuppoſe, that the third ſpecies of Royal power, is taken by him, both in an ordinary, and extraordinary acceptation. And he only illuſtrateth it, as it is taken in an extraordinary ſenſe, becauſe that way it is more material then the other way. He paſſeth the illuſtration thereof, as it is taken in an ordinary notion, becauſe ſo it is not only leſſe material, but alſo that way it is more clear then the other way. Or I may ſay, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confoundeth theſe two notions together, becauſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritively aeſymnetick Monarchy taken in an extraordinary notion, may be called ordinary. The reaſon of this is, becauſe men at leaſt may be, becauſe of perſonal endowments more frequently called to govern in an abſolute and ordinary way, then for extraordinary Heroiciſm, and ſuch like. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, this I know, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reckoned-up no other kinds of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, but ſuch as have power to, and do govern according to Law. But theſe, who are advanced to an illimited power becauſe of perſonal endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not preciſely called thereto to govern, whether according to, or againſt Law. That doth militate againſt the ground and motive of their call. They are no otherwiſe called to govern according to their pleaſure, but as people expect, their will ſhal bring forth the choiceſt Laws. Whence
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114526:60"/>
preciſely and formally, their power both according to the ſubject and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, is reſtricted and kept within the bounds of Law. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſo of abſolute Monarchy, acquired and conferred by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heroiciſm and ſuch like. And conſequently we may very juſtly ſay, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> referreth abſolute Monarchy, obtained becauſe of perſonal endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the third ſpecies of Regal government, and doth not refer abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy becauſe of extraordinary heroiciſm and ſuch like, to any ſpecies or kind of Monarchy he ſpeaketh of The reaſon we ſay, is this, becauſe any kind of Monarchy he ſpeaketh of, doth not exceed the bounds of Law. But illimited Royal power conferred, becauſe of extraordinary qualifications, preciſely and formally doth not exceed the bounds of Law. Whereas being conferred upon grounds of extraordinary heroiciſm, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and ſuch like, preciſely and formally the power thereof out-reacheth all Laws. Thus we judge <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s mind to be cleared concerning all the ſpecies and ſorts of Monarchy ſummed-up by him.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> imagineth that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> by Pambaſilick, or all-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Monarchy, doth mean arbitrary Monarchy, having power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern at random, either according to, or againſt Law. But the Gentleman in this is a little miſtaken: for otherwiſe in the moulding of the King he had not required ſuch conditions and limitations as he doth. Which be theſe. 1. That he ſhould deſcend of ſuch a race, which in vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould exceed all others, <hi>Pol.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1 2. Whence is it, that both there, and <hi>Polit.</hi> 1. <hi>cap,</hi> 3. he ſaith, that the beſt, according to nature, over-ruleth that which is worſe, and leſſe good. 2. That the King himſelf ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the reſt in vertue and goodneſſe. Yea, but for a King to govern accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own hearts luſt, even againſt Law and Reaſon, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of vertue and goodneſſe, ſeing illegality and injuſtice flow from a vicious and corrupt principle. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in oppoſing Monarchy, or Government laid upon one, to Government carried-on and managed according to Law, doth not inſinuate an arbitrary power in the King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving immunity and freedom from Law; but in ſo doing he only oppoſeth the power of Government laid upon one, to its power being laid upon many, implying, that as in this reſpect the Governour is ſubject to the reſt, and cannot act any thing of Law without their conſent and aſſiſtance; ſo in the other reſpect the Governour in carrying on things according to Law, hath immunity from ſubjection to any other beſide, and in doing things legally may perform them without the interpoſition of any other man's authority. Whence we ſee that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alloweth an abſolute power in the king to act according to Law, but not to act either according to Law or againſt it. And therefore in ſo far he taketh theſe by the hand, who deny Monarchy to be according to nature, in as far as they contend, that to be againſt Nature, which is againſt Law. Which maketh him conclude, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny to be againſt Nature, it being againſt Law and Reaſon. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he doth not allow arbitrary power in the king, to do either good
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114526:61"/>
or bad according to his pleaſure. He only pleadeth for power to the King, which is according to Nature, Juſtice and Utility. He will have him a man excelling others in vertue, and governing according to Law. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. to render it an arbitrary power. There is a very great difference between <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he expoundeth it himſelf, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and defineth it to be a power <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to govern the city, and all the publick matters, whether at home or abroad. thus the man ſpeaketh of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power. but arbitrary power is a miſgoverning power. he ſpeaketh of a power ordering and doing all things. but arbitrary power is a power of miſordering and undoing all things. it doth not follow, that becauſe kings of old had power over all things: <hi>Ergo</hi> they had power to diſpoſe on them according to their pleaſure <hi>Quaſibero</hi> there were not an all-comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power, according to Law. This conſequence doth not immediately follow from the <hi>Antecedent.</hi> It is a fallacy <hi>ab homonymia:</hi> for there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold all-commanding power, one according to, and another above Law. 'Tis therefore a poor ſhift, to conclude an arbitrary power from an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanding power. The original <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth bear an arbitrary power, only by way of analogy. and it is known, that the <hi>Roman Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> had <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-commanding power, though not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-willing power. Well, let it be ſo that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That kings in ancient times had an arbitrary power, a power above Law. But I pray you, what kings then doth he underſtand? Either they are the Founders of the primary Colonies, or the after-Heroes and Founders of the ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Colonies. If of the firſt kind, <hi>ergo</hi> you gain juſt nothing. We have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that already, <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. Their power was extraordinary. If of the ſecond kind, we might alſo therein take you by the hand. Howſoever with ſome diſtinction or other you have our mind cleared in this, <hi>ibid.</hi> Therfore how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you underſtand the latter part of the fourth Species, I loſe nothing. If you ſay that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> only meaneth in it an all-commanding power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, then do I gain my purpoſe. And if you ſuppoſe his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be otherwiſe, you learn from what foregoeth, that I loſe nothing. Thus the caſe is extraordinary. And I deny not but Royal power that way hath been arbitrary. Yet you cannot deny, but the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth (or the former part thereof) Species of Monarchy, do not ſpeak a word of Royal power above Law.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s words may bear this conſtruction, yet do we judge it were correſponding to his ſenſe and meaning, to put this ſenſe upon them. In the former part of the fourth Species he contradiſtinguiſheth the times of the Heroes from the ancient times, which he expreſſeth in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part thereof. But the one being oppoſed to the other, if we ſpeak rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114526:61"/>
and properly, by the ancient times can be nothing underſtood but the golden age: which after the flood (Ethnick Writers know no time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood) laſted, as ſome ſay, 250 years, and as others ſay with better warrant, 131 years. All which time, if we ſpeak properly and rigorouſly, there was no kingly government at all: for, as is ſhewed already <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. there was no government then but natural and oeconomick.—<hi>In qua nullo ferente legem, natura ipſa vivebatur,—Mneſ. Phoen. Damaſc. lib.</hi> 97. <hi>biſt. drchil. de temp.</hi> Not withſtanding this, I do imagine, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> opinionateth, there were Kings in the golden age. <hi>Fuerat enim antiqua Civitatum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>guhernatio, rationabiliter, pancorum &amp; regia.

And yet they ſay, before this time <hi>Imperium penes Reges erat.</hi> What is meant by theſe <hi>Reges, Fabius Pictor</hi> explaineth. <hi>Principes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quia juſti erant &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionibus dediti, jure habiti Dii &amp; dicti.

And yet in the preceding words he ſaith, <hi>Ea aetate nulla erat monarchia, quia mortalium pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus nondum boeſerat ulla regnandi cupiditas.</hi> Therefore by theſe <hi>Reges,</hi> and <hi>Principes</hi> can be nothing elſe underſtood, but the fathers and heads of the chief families, as <hi>Shem, Japhet,</hi> &amp;c. over all whom <hi>Noah</hi> did rule as a common father.

Yet we muſt not imagine that this arbitrary power which they had was ſo, preciſely and formally. If we ſpeak rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, arbitrary power conferred becauſe of intimate and natural relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perſonal endowments, is rather limited then illimited: for as the grounds thereof tie the people to all due obedience and ſubjection, ſo they tie the Prince to every due and lawful way of governing, and that in a moſt intenſe and extraordinary way.

                  <p>As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is very unclear in the latter part, ſo is he likewiſe intricate in the former part of the fourth ſpecies. In it he ſaith that the Kings in the

Yet I may very conveniently uſe thoſe diſtinctions which are expreſſed, <hi>concl.</hi> 2. But for further clearing this point, we ſhall ſtand here a-little to illuſtrate by Example all theſe wayes <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſetteth down in the former part of the fourth ſpecies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by heroick Kings came to their Crowns. In ſumming them up we ſhall obſerve a more exact and reſolutory method then <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth. (1.) By gathering people together and planting Colonies. Which is conſidered four wayes.

Secondly by way of donation. Thirdly, by way of ſubordination. Fourthly, by way of purchaſe and acquiſition.

And notwithſtanding this, we may very probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude either of the parts, whether by granting or by denying, the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of the founders of theſe Colonies.

Amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> the <hi>Heraclids</hi> who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Mycenae,</hi> and <hi>Alemeon</hi> who ſubdued the Kingdom of <hi>Thcb. s. Diod. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and 6. (3.) Becauſe of the benevolence and bountifulneſſe of anceſtours.

(4) By cunning and art. This may be taken two wayes. Firſtly, as it implieth a conferring of the Kingly power, becauſe of engine and invention. Thus the <hi>Thebans</hi> advanced <hi>Oedipus</hi> to reign over them, <hi>Sophocl. in Oed. tyr. Diod. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Secondly, as it implieth a cunning and ſubtil way of obtaining the Kingdom. So <hi>Cameſenuus</hi> obtained the Kingdom of <hi>Baciria, Ber. lib.</hi> 5. and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> acquired the Kingdom of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which belonged to his father <hi>Achilles, Dict.

Theſe things being thus illuſtrated by example, I do nextly deſire the Reader carefully to diſtinguiſh between extraordinary and ordinary Heroes, and between thoſe of them who were in the precedent times and thoſe who were in the ſubſequent times of Heroiciſm. For my-ſelf I cannot ſay, but extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Heroes at leaſt, and the founders of primary Colonies, were inveſted with a vaſt and arbitrary power. But as for the ordinary Heroes, and the after-founders of Colonies, I am contented with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to ſay, That their power was hemmed-in by the hedges of Law. We find ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples amongſt the after-heroes to this purpoſe. <hi>Priamus</hi> was not only withſtood by his own ſubjects, who did ſteal <hi>Helena,</hi> but alſo what he did therein either firſtly or laſtly, was according to the advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Senatours. <hi>Dict, Cret. de bel. Tro. lib.</hi> 1. &amp; 5. <hi>Dar. Phr. ae excid. Tro. lib.</hi> And though <hi>Dares Phrygius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Priamus</hi> determined and voiced otherwiſe then they who followed <hi>Antenor</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> (who appear to us to have been the <hi>major</hi> part of the Senat: for we gather from both theſe Hiſtorians, that not only the greateſt part of the Senate, but alſo the whole body of the People were for the concluding and drawing up peace with the <hi>Grecians.</hi> I confeſſe <hi>Dares Phrygius</hi> in plain terms faith that <hi>Priamus</hi> voiced againſt peace, and truce taking-up with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and what he voiced was eſtabliſhed and holden as a thing concluded-on by all. Indeed, he carried it contrary to all who oppoſed him, as <hi>Dares</hi> will have it. Yet <hi>Dictys</hi> ſtorieth the juſt contrary, and ſaith, that <hi>Priamus,</hi> followed the advice and determination of the Senat. And indeed <hi>Q. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laber, lib.</hi> 12. and <hi>Tryphiodor, de Il. exc.</hi> inſinuate no leſſe for they obſerve <hi>Dictys</hi> way, which he hath in ſtorying the <hi>Grecian ſtratagem</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued upon terms of peace concluded on between the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Grecians.</hi> Howſoever, albeit I think my-ſelf rather oblidged to encline to <hi>Dares</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yet loſe I nothing thereby, if I do ſo. I am not of that opinion to think, that <hi>Priamus</hi> was ſo hemmed-in by Law, as the <hi>Lacedemonian Kings.</hi> Let it be ſo, he had a negative voice in Senate, as <hi>Dares</hi> in ſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; yet ſure I am none will ſay, that the Senate was a cypher, having no authority at all. You will learn from theſe fore-cited hiſtorians the contrary of that. And in ſo far as <hi>Priamus</hi> did act according to the advice &amp; counſel of the Senat, in as far he did act according to Law. Thus he did not ſimply act according to pleaſure, and in an arbitrary way. No verily. In this his power was ſomewhat limited. And this is all that both <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and we do crave. And ſo we muſt not think but <hi>Alcinous</hi> was ſome way or other regulated by his Princes and Rulers, as you may read, <hi>Hom, odyſ.</hi> 8.

We need not think it ſtrange to ſay, that in the dayes of the Heroes Kings were ſome what ſubjected to Law: for not only <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> but alſo <hi>Theſeus,</hi> were no leſte ſubjected to Law, as is ſhewed already, then the <hi>Lacedemonian kings?</hi> 'Tis obſervable, that <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> ſon to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and King of <hi>Mycenae,</hi> was judged and abſolved by the Councel of <hi>Areopagus.</hi> Him <hi>Mneſtheus,</hi> ſon to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and King of <hi>Athens,</hi> could not get ſet free, till firſtly he was examined by the <hi>Areopagites</hi> whom <hi>Dictys</hi> calleth moſt ſtrict Juſticiaries, <hi>de bel.

                  <p>We ſhall ſtand here a while, to ſpeak of the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> for it is not only the chief ſubject of our diſcourſe, in order to which we drive all that we ſpeak, but alſo it falleth-in here by a ſtring-line. Already we have ſpoken of it at length, from the dayes of the Conquerour, or a little before, until now. It therefore remaineth, we ſpeak of it, as it was from its beginning unto the reign of the <hi>Normans.</hi> And ſo we conſider it under theſe notions. 1. As it was in its firſt beginning and original And though I will not ſay, that <hi>Britain</hi> was inhabited ſo ſoon as other Kingdoms, which lie in, and about the middle and chief part of the Earth. No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſuch parts were firſtly inhabited, as both hiſtory and reaſon doth teach. Yet I may very conveniently ſay, that the chiefeſt Kingdoms, and thoſe which he next <hi>Armenia,</hi> being planted, after people were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiplied on the earth, they did ſeek out to inhabit the uttermoſt Iſles of the world. There was a phyſical neceſſity for this. People daily mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114526:63"/>
could not dwell all in one part, but of neceſſity they behoved to depart one from another, for reſidence ſake Yea, there was a moral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it alſo. No queſtion, deſire of great lands and poſſeſſions, ſo ſoon as people were greatly multiplied on the earth after the flood, could not but ſet them a work to ſeek-out the remoteſt parts. This is confirmed by what the holy Ghoſt faith: <hi>The ſons of Japhet, Gomer,—by theſe were the Iſles of the Gentiles divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. Gen.</hi> 10. I pray you tell me, whileas the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh there indefinitely of the Iſles of the Nations, if he doth exclude the Iſle of <hi>Britain?</hi> What more reaſon is there to exclude it then any other? And for my ſelf I think, there is more reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it then any of the reſt. Firſtly, becauſe it is the chiefeſt Iſle in the world. And therefore in it ſelf the more delectable, and the more to be ſought after. Secondly, becauſe <hi>Gomer,</hi> whom <hi>Beroſus</hi> calleth <hi>Comerus Gallus,</hi> did come into <hi>Italy,</hi> and erected Colonies there, <hi>Ant. lib.</hi> 5. Now tell me, is it not moſt probable that <hi>Gomer</hi> did tranſlate Colonies from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Britain,</hi> every-one of them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contiguouſly one with another?

And thus very appoſitely it partaketh of the ſignification of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's</hi> ſurname. And why ſhall we not think, whether <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Britain</hi> one way or other, have their denomination from the names of their firſt founders, as well as other nations and kingdomes have their names from the founders, who firſtly erected them? <hi>V.G.

Yet I may ſay, that he did ſend Colonies nextly into <hi>Britain,</hi> which is adjacent to <hi>France.</hi> Verily, he might have <hi>ſimul,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> tranſlated Colonies into both: for as <hi>France</hi> is next adjacent to <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo <hi>Britain</hi> is next adjacent to <hi>France.</hi> I cannot imagine, that <hi>Britain</hi> lying ſo near <hi>Italy,</hi> that ever <hi>Gomer</hi> would have leſt it unplanted, till by the multiplication of Colonies in <hi>France,</hi> people out of <hi>France</hi> had been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Britain</hi> to plant it. Howſoever I ſtand not on this, but ſure I am, both <hi>Frenches</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> have their original from <hi>Comerus Gallus,</hi> as <hi>Camden</hi> very notably and at length proveth, <hi>Brit.

But what Government they had amongſt them after <hi>Gomer</hi>'s death, cannot be determined.

And in reſpect of this time, <hi>Dio Nic. ex Xiphtl epit. de Brit.</hi> ſaith very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, <hi>Apud hos populus magna ex parte principatum tenet.</hi> And <hi>Camden</hi> noteth, That as the <hi>Frenches,</hi> ſo the <hi>Britains</hi> in old were not governed by one, but by many.

Howſoever you will do well to obſerve with me, that in old, <hi>France</hi> was divided into three parts, according as <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Mela</hi> do ſtory. But <hi>Beroſus</hi> divideth it into two parts; the one he calleth <hi>Gallia,</hi> and the other <hi>Celtae.</hi> But for reconciling theſe diviſions, you ſhall know, that <hi>Beroſus</hi> ſpeaketh of a more large diviſion then they do. He contradiſtinguiſheth theſe three Kingdoms one from another, <hi>viz. Italy, Celtae,</hi> and <hi>Gallia.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Italy</hi> he calleth <hi>Comari,</hi> from their King <hi>Comerus.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Celtae</hi> he calleth <hi>Diſceltes,</hi> or <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> whoſe firſt King (ſaith he) was <hi>Samotes.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Gallia</hi> he calleth <hi>Galli:</hi> for (faith he) <hi>Comer</hi>'s nephews did ſo call them from his ſurname, <hi>Gallus.</hi> This inſinuateth, that <hi>Comer</hi>'s nephews ſent-out with Colonies from him, did firſtly plant and inhabit <hi>Gallia.</hi> Which maketh us conclude, that <hi>Gallia</hi> includeth both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> No queſtion, the inhabitants of both in old have been called <hi>Galli,</hi> from <hi>Gallus,</hi> the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Comerus,</hi> ſeing both of them were alike planted by him and his poſterity. We need not think it ſtrange, to ſay, that both of them do paſs under the ſame epithet and notion: for the <hi>Frenches</hi> are called <hi>Cimbri,</hi> as <hi>Valerius maximus, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Appianus</hi> ſay; and <hi>Gomeri,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> teach. So the <hi>Britains</hi> are called <hi>Kimbri,</hi> changing <hi>C,</hi> into <hi>K.</hi> and <hi>Cumeri,</hi> changing <hi>Go,</hi> into <hi>Cu.</hi> They are ſo both called from <hi>Gomer,</hi> or <hi>Comer,</hi> the name of <hi>Gallus.</hi> And conſequently, ſeing they both have one common epithet from his forename, why may they not alſo paſſe under one notion, and be called <hi>Galli</hi> from <hi>Gallus</hi> his ſurname? I wil not much contend, whether the <hi>Frenches</hi> or <hi>Britains</hi> had Kings after the dayes of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> and his nephews, or not. And if they had any, ſure I am they were
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114526:64"/>
governed by moe then one. No queſtion, the Land in both was divided into divers Satrapees. So we find the Kingdom of <hi>Italy</hi> in old, to have been ſo divided. Yet we do not think, but amongſt thoſe Satrapees there hath been one greater then any of the reſt. As no queſtion, in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Comars</hi> were more powerful then any of the reſt of the Colonies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Kingdom, as you may learn from <hi>Beroſ. ant. lib.</hi> 5. So amongſt the <hi>Frenches,</hi> the chiefeſt Kingdom was the Satrapee of the <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> Thence it is that <hi>Beroſus, ant. lib.</hi> 5. doth reckon-up in a catalogue the Kings of the <hi>Celtes,</hi> as he doth the <hi>Aſſyrian Kings;</hi> and <hi>Manetho</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning where <hi>Beroſus</hi> leſt, ſummeth-up one by one the Kings of the <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> as he doth reckon-up the <hi>Egyptian Kings.</hi> Thus there is no repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie between the diviſions of <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Mela:</hi> for he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a general and large diviſion, and they keep themſelves within more reſtricted and narrow bounds.

The chief people in <hi>Aquitania</hi> were called <hi>Auſci,</hi> in <hi>Belgia, Treveri,</hi> and in <hi>Celtae, Hedui. Mel. de ſit. Orb. cap.</hi> 2. And the chief Magiſtracy amongſt the <hi>Hedui,</hi> was called <hi>Vergobretus.</hi> With which in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s dayes <hi>Divitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Ltſcus</hi> were inveſted. Which was a yearly Magiſtracy, having power both of life and death, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> faith, <hi>de bel. Gal. lib.</hi> 1. What the <hi>Vergobret</hi> did amongſt the <hi>Hedui,</hi> was done, <hi>convocatis corum principibus.</hi> Thoſe who were clothed with it as they were annual and but for a time, ſo they did nothing abſolutely and by themſelves, but according to the counſel and advice of the Princes. This is far from the arbitrary power that <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſpeaketh-of. Yet we will not ſay, that the power of the <hi>Celtick Kings</hi> was alwayes ſo hemmed-in by Law. I do not think but their primary founders, not only amongſt the <hi>Celtes,</hi> but alſo amongſt the <hi>Aquitans</hi> and <hi>Belgiſts,</hi> had a vaſt and arbitrary power. Yea and their after Kings ſo long as the flower of Heroiciſm laſted, had ſuch power as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh-of (and which by us is already expreſſed) in the fourth ſpecies, or in the former part of the fourth ſpecies of Monarchy, <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10, &amp; 11. And ſo, the flower of Heroiciſm fading, and Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wearing out of requeſt, no queſtion, there hath been no more power left to their Kings, then what <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpeaketh-of in the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-cited.

Which maketh us opinionat that <hi>Galtea,</hi> or <hi>Celtice,</hi> was daughter to <hi>Celte:</hi> for, as <hi>Beroſus</hi> ſaith, with the conſent and permiſſion of her parents, <hi>Galatis</hi> was born of her, King to the <hi>Celtes.</hi> And who I pray you, had power to put ſuch a diſpoſition and right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Galatis,</hi> but the King and Queen of the Celtes. I warrant you, ſuch a thing ſtanding upon conſent and renunciation, without being obtained by ſtrength of Arms, the conſent and permiſſion given to <hi>Hercules</hi> ſon to reigne over the <hi>Celtes,</hi> was not ſought from any inſeriour, but from him whoſe intereſt it was to reign as King. I trow, it ſtood not upon the conſent and permiſſion of any ſubject, that <hi>Hercules</hi> ſon ſhould be born King to the <hi>Celtes.</hi> And conſequently, <hi>Celte</hi> at this time being King over the <hi>Celtes,</hi> was <hi>Galtea</hi>'s father, by whom it was given, that <hi>Galatus</hi> (<hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſon) ſhould be born his ſucceſſor and King after him. Therfore, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Beroſus</hi> I conclude, that the <hi>Celtes</hi> were ſo called from <hi>Celte</hi> giand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Galatis,</hi> and <hi>Galli,</hi> or <hi>Galatoe</hi> from <hi>Galatis,</hi> nephew to <hi>Celte,</hi> and ſon to <hi>Hercules.</hi> Yet <hi>Nicoeus</hi> poſitively and expreſſely calleth <hi>Celtice,</hi> or <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea</hi> her father, <hi>Bretan,</hi> From whom <hi>Heſichtus,</hi> as is ſaid already, deduceth the originall of the <hi>Britains.</hi> And this being true it followeth, that <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Brutus</hi> is more ancient then they ordinarily talk-of. Althought I do fully imagine, that <hi>Britain</hi> hath it's denomination from this <hi>Bretan;</hi> yet I will never think, but <hi>Britain</hi> was inhabited ere ever this <hi>Bretan</hi> was. The <hi>Celtes</hi> are ſo called from <hi>Celte,</hi> and <hi>Galli</hi> or <hi>Galatoe,</hi> from <hi>Galatis.</hi> And yet they were a people long before their dayes. Verily, I think it moſt likely, that <hi>Britain</hi> hath it's denomination from <hi>Bretan,</hi> and was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly en peopled by him: for reſigning the Kingdom of the <hi>Celtes</hi> to <hi>Hercules</hi> ſon his nephew, it is more then apparent, that being a King all his life-time before, for his own honour and advantage, he hath gathered a number of people together out of his own Kingdom, and tranſlated them into <hi>Britain,</hi> and there erected a Kingdom. This was more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and advantageable to him, then to live a privat life in ſubjection to his nephew. What? can it be imagined but deſire of wealth and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114526:66"/>
honour both to himſelf and his poſterity, would have drawen him on to ſuch an under-taking? No queſtion, he being a powerfull King, and father-in-law to the great Monarch <hi>Hercules,</hi> on whoſe ſon he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a ſingular courteſie, in renouncing the kingdom to him, did want nothing that conduced, not only for undertaking but alſo for effectuating ſuch a purpoſe. Wanting his own kingdom, <hi>Britam,</hi> a glorious kingdom lying next to <hi>France,</hi> either at that time ſcarcely enpeopled, or at leaſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with men of rude breeding, it cannot come in my mind to think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but this <hi>Bretan</hi> became <hi>Brutus</hi> to <hi>Britain.</hi> And this I take to be him, about whom they controvert ſo much. Which agreeth with that which is ſtoried, ſaying, That the <hi>Britans</hi> were a people of <hi>leſſer Britany,</hi> which is in the <hi>Celtick region,</hi> who in old did inhabit the Iſle of <hi>Britain.</hi> Whether you ſhall imagine, this <hi>Bretan,</hi> and <hi>Brito,</hi> to be all one, or that the <hi>Trojans</hi> came into <hi>Britain,</hi> whileas they came along into <hi>France,</hi> I remit it to the Reader to judge, as a thing arbitrary and indiſterent. And herein I do not contemn the authority of <hi>Waldhave,</hi> who calleth <hi>Britain Brute</hi>'s Lands. Thus concerning the original of <hi>Britain,</hi> firſtly, and laſtly, I have offered my judgment freely, which being arightly conſidered, doth much ſerve to reconcile all different opinions in this matter. Well, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſay that <hi>Bretan</hi> came into this Iſle with <hi>Bretanes,</hi> or <hi>Brutus,</hi> with <hi>Trojans,</hi> (I ſhall not ſtand to controvert, if he be <hi>Brito</hi> of whom <hi>Hyginus</hi> ſpeaketh) whileas <hi>Francus</hi> ſon to <hi>Hector</hi> came along into <hi>France,</hi> and did reign there, what power they had is already ſhewed, but namely <hi>concl.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>It being ſufficiently proved, that <hi>Britain</hi> was ſecondly enpeopled by <hi>Bretan,</hi> and very probably concluded to have been enpeopled the third time by fugitive and diſperſed <hi>Trojans,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Brito,</hi> of whom, (as we may probably ſay, though the contrary may be alſo hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) <hi>Hyginus</hi> ſpeaketh: It now remaineth to conſider what power thoſe Kings had who ſucceeded <hi>Bretan</hi> and <hi>Brito.</hi> The tract of time which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terveened between theſe two Kings, may be eaſily learned: for it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therable from <hi>Beroſus,</hi> that <hi>Bretan</hi> erected his kingdom under the reign of <hi>Baleus, R. Aſſyr.</hi> XI in, or about the fourteenth, or ſixteenth year of his reign, <hi>ann mund.</hi> 2225, or 2227, and <hi>Brito</hi> did ſet-up his kingdom in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> (as may be gathered from <hi>Manetho</hi>) in, or about the firſt, or ſecond year of <hi>Teutheus</hi> reign, King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> XXIX, in, and about the year of the world 2791, or 2792. Concerning the power of theſe tow Kings we have ſpoken. And we come nextly to ſpeak of the power of thoſe Kings who ſucceeded them, untill the dayes of C. <hi>Cieſar.</hi> Out of no ancient Writer we can learn in particular what thoſe Kings were. But in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral we learn theſe two things. 1. That in old, <hi>Britain</hi> was governed by Kings. 2. That afterward (though before <hi>Caſars</hi> time) it was divided into Satrapees, and governed by many Princes. We take it upon us, to illuſtrate and prove both theſe. The firſt is evident from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114526:66"/>
ſaith. Olim <hi>Regilus parebant.</hi> To which he inunediatly ſubjoineth, <hi>Nane per principes Jactionibus &amp; ſtudiis trahuntio.</hi> Thus he diſtinguiſheth between the condition of <hi>Britain,</hi> as it was in old, and as it was in and about his time, In old (ſaith he) it was governed by Kings, but now being divided into factions it is governed by Princes. And therefore in another place he ſaith, <hi>a regibus, uſe an principes.</hi> But <hi>Salmaſ.</hi> by <hi>principes</hi> underſtandeth the <hi>Roman Caeſars, Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 8. He ſaith ſo that he may elude the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> by many. He would have it to paſſe (if he could get it) that it was never governed but by Kings. It is no wonder that he be blinded in other things, ſeing he ſhuttcth his eyes at ſo clear a light as this. It cannot be denied but <hi>Tatitus</hi> ſpeaks of the government of <hi>England</hi> as it was in old, and as it was in and about his time. 1. Becauſe it is very unlike that ever he would have called the <hi>Roman Caeſars,</hi> Princes. 'Tis an epither of leſſe honour and power then Kings. And ſo I imagine, that he would rather have called the Kings of <hi>England</hi> Princes then them. Sure I am, the <hi>Rontan Caeſars</hi> were more powerful &amp; did reign in a more kingly way then the <hi>Engliſh Kings.</hi> 2.

Orb. lib. 3 cap 6.</hi> And what power thoſe Kings had, I mind not to ſay preciſely that it was ſo reſtricted as the power of the <hi>Lacedomoril in Kings.</hi> Neither will I ſay, that it was ſo narrow as the power of the <hi>Engliſh Kings,</hi> after the Conquerour. Yet I may juſtly ſay, That it was not boundleſs and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> dreameth-of. So ſaith <hi>Die Niceus, ex Xiph. epit. Apud hos populus magna ex parte prineipatum tenet. i.e.</hi> Amongſt them (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Britams</hi>) the People in a great part do govern. This telleth, that in old, even in the time of Kings, in <hi>Britain,</hi> there was Popular Government. Kings then in <hi>Britain</hi> were not ſole Lords, but the People did govern al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Hence it is that <hi>Cordilla juſſu papuli,</hi> was ſet to reign over the <hi>Britains.</hi> So <hi>Gintolinus Populi jaſſu, Rex dicitur, Polyd. Ang. hiſt. lib.</hi> 1. Becauſe of the People's ſwaying power of old in <hi>Britain,</hi> Kingly Government ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114526:67"/>
before the dayes of C. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was altogether abrogated, as in part is ſhewed already. But <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſhall not think that of old <hi>England</hi> was ſingular in this. There were in old other parts in <hi>Britain,</hi> where the kingly power was limited and hemmed-in by Law. Concerning the <hi>AEbudan Iſles, Solinus</hi> thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Rex unus eſt univerſis.Rex nihil ſuum habet, omnia univerſorum, ad aequitatem certis legibus ſtringitur. Ac ne avaritia diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat a vero, diſcit paupertate juſtitiam, utpote cui nihil ſit rei familiaris, cap.</hi> 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> all of them have one King.—The King hath nothing proper, all things belong to the people, he is compelled to equity, by certain Laws. And leſt avarice ſhould withdraw him from the truth he is taught juſtice by poverty, (to wit) as one that hath nothing belonging to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond particular is maniſeſt from <hi>Strabo,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Complures apud eos ſunt dominationes, lib.</hi> 4. In the original <hi>dominationes</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which ſigniſieth Princes or Rulers. Thus they were governed toward his time, by many and not by one. And <hi>Salmaſius</hi> from this is made ſo to ſay, albeit he endeavoureth to elude what <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, <hi>hiſt. lib.</hi> 1. The words are already cited and vindicated. But <hi>Diodore</hi> is moſt clear to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſpeaking of <hi>Britain. Reges, principeſque, ibi ſunt plures, pacem invicem ſervantes, Rev. ant. lib</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. But ſure I am, <hi>Salinaſius</hi> will not ſay, that ſuch had an abſolute power over the people. Their Kings had not ſuch power: <hi>Ergo</hi> far leſſe they. Yea, the <hi>Heduan Vergobret,</hi> who did reign over moe then any of them, had not an abſolute and arbitrary power. Which maketh me think, far leſſe had they any ſuch power. And tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable what they did, was <hi>communi concilio, Caeſar de bel. Gal. lib</hi> 5. So much touching the State of <hi>England</hi> in the ſecond notion, <hi>i. e.</hi> as it was from the dayes of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>3. We come now to ſpeak of <hi>England,</hi> as it was under the <hi>Romans, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi> As it was under the <hi>Roman yoke</hi> (ſpeaking preciſely) <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had no Kings but the <hi>Roman Emperours.</hi> And what power they had, is ſpoken already, concerning the <hi>Roman Dictators.</hi> And as for the power of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Saxonick Kings</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> no queſtion, they had greater power then any of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in old, or ſince the dayes of the Conquerour, if we except K. <hi>James.</hi> But to ſay, that their power was boundleſs and arbitrary, is more then I dare affirm. I will not deny, but the firſt, whether of the <hi>Daniſh,</hi> or the <hi>Saxonick Kings,</hi> had that ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which the Conquerour had over <hi>England.</hi> As he ſubdued <hi>England,</hi> ſo did they. And it is the Conquerours priviledge, to rule at random; Such do ordinarily conquer againſt Law. And I pray you, why do they not alſo rule without Law? But that all who ſucceeded theſe, had the like power alſo, I cannot be moved to affirm. It cannot be denied, but even under their reign there were Parliaments and Councels. And I trow, they were not cyphers. I might enlarge this, but I judge it needleſs: for I care not which of the parts be affirmed. Under theſe Kings, <hi>England</hi> was not its own, but a ſubdued, and unſetled Nation. Which maketh me ſay,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114526:67"/>
that it was no wonder, albeit then there was no time for it to exerciſe the Laws againſt its Kings. Thus at length I have offered my judgment freely concerning the power of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> both of old and of late. And that we may ſhut up this whole purpoſe in a word, for eut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-off all that <hi>Salmaſius</hi> can object, you ſhall be pleaſed carefully to diſtinguiſh between extraordinary and ordinary Monarchy. As for an extraordinary Regal power, which was conſerred on Kings, whether for extraordinary heroiciſm; perſonal endowments, or ſuch like we ſhall not ſtand to ſay, that ſuch had not only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, but alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an all-willing and arbitrary power. See <hi>Cocl.</hi> 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4. Yet we cannot ſay ſo much of ordinary Monarchy, if we look to the preciſe and ordinary way of the power of Kings. This by example is at length ſhe wed already. And ſo we come, </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prove it by reaſon. Can any in reaſon imagine, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unleſſe it be for ſome extraordinary cauſe or other, will ſubject their necks to the pleaſure and arbitrement of any? Nay, it is a combing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hair, for people to reſignitheir liberty into the hands of any man, giving him a full power to diſpoſe upon them at random. It is very obſervable, That once Kings in <hi>Aſia</hi> had not only an all-commanding, but alſo an all-willing power. So <hi>Nomrod, Belus, Ninus,</hi> and <hi>Semiramis,</hi> as is ſhewed already, <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. And yet at laſt this pambaſilick and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, turned over into a deſpotick power governing <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, according to Law. <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Under theſe four Kings the condition of Regal power was very extraordinary. And ſo it was no wonder, though they did reign in an extraordinary way, having more will then other Kings. But the kingdom becoming ſetl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, the power of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours was hemmed-in. Their wings were a little clipped. And may we not judge ſo of all other Nations? Verily, I think it holdeth <hi>a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jori:</hi> for the <hi>Aſſyrian Kings</hi> were univerſal Monarchs, and no kingdom could ever match with the <hi>Aſſyrian empire.</hi> Which makes me imagin, that as the Kings of the <hi>Aſſyrian empire</hi> in an ordinary and ſotled caſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Law, far more in that reſpect hath the caſe of other kings been ſuch. And withall obſerve, there was a time, when Regal Government was much in requeſt. It was much cried-up in the dayes of Heraiciſm. And that rather in the flower and beginnings, then in the ſadings and after-times thereof. And ſo it was no wonder though at that time kings were inveſted with a vaſt power.

Neither can you ſhew me (as is proved already) that in the dayes of the Heroes, regal power was arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, unleſſe it had been in ſome extraordinary caſe. Well, I ſtand not to grant, that arbitrary power once acquired, may endure ſome few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.

And though <hi>Ottanes</hi> deſineth Monarchy to be, that to which every thing is lawful unpuniſhably; yet he doth ſo by way of taxing the greatneſſe thereof. And poſitively he taxeth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Perſien Kings,</hi> objecting to the people the licentious arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> and <hi>Magus.</hi> Thus he endeavoureth to diſſwade the People from eſtabliſhing Monarchy, telling them, that it was neither good nor pleaſant. And he giveth this reaſon for it: becauſe (ſaith he) it hath a priviledge to do every thing unpuniſhably, <hi>Herod. lib. 3.</hi> So then he deſineth Monarchy after that manner, not becauſe he eſteemeth it to be its due priviledge but becauſe he holdeth it as that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to it againſt the pleaſure and profit of the people. Therefore is it, that he uſeth it as a diſſwading motive, for provoking the people no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſet-up Monarchy amongſt them. We ſtand not here to gloſſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus</hi> mind, who commendeth that Law amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whereby was enacted, That the King ſhould be honoured as the Image of GOD. He was a great Courtier with the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> And it is the leaſt thing Conrtiers can do, to ſlatter. Although we do verily think, that <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did allow vaſt and arbitrary power in the <hi>Perſian King,</hi> yet that can be hardly drawn from his words. In Scripture, Kings are called Gods, and we are commanded to honour them as GOD's Vicegerents; yet doth it not follow, that according to Scripture-ſtile they are abſolute, and have an arbitrary power. And we admit that of <hi>Claudian,</hi> who ſaith, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> gave alike obedience to cruel and tyranous Kings. Therefore was it, that by the very Law of the kingdom, arbitrary power was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon their Kings, and continued ſo long as the <hi>Perſian Monarchy</hi> endured. And though the <hi>Ferſian King</hi> had an abſolute power in making, yet not in breaking Laws as is ſaid already. It is already ſhewed by us, That in ſome things the power of the <hi>Perſian King</hi> was reſtricted.</p>

                     <hi>Salmaſius</hi> needeth not to tell us, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did not bring their Kings to the Stage. This is blocked-up already from his ſingers. And though they did bear much with <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> it was no wonder: for he ſubdued them. And what can a ſubdued people do, but ſuffer? And 'tis known that <hi>Cambyſet</hi> himſelf was a vile tyrant. Therefore the ſtory of <hi>Judeth</hi> calleth him <hi>Nabuchodonoſor.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Joſephus</hi> alſo.

But knowing, that there are many Court-paraſites, I regard not though you reckon-up <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantas</hi> amongſt them. Yea, it is already ſhewed by us, That the <hi>Roman Kings</hi> were regulated. And albeit we ſhould grant, that <hi>Romulus</hi> was an abſolute Prince, yet would <hi>Salmaſius</hi> gain juſt nothing: for by his conduct and induſtry he made the <hi>Romans</hi> a People. And we have ſaid already, that ſuch kings, from whoſe conduct the people's welfare doth intimatly depend, have been abſolute. But the caſe of ſuch is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. And as for that which <hi>Pomponius</hi> ſaith, it needeth a diſtinction. It cannot be denied, but <hi>Romulus</hi> had a pambaſilick power before the Senat was erected by him. But after it was eſtabliſhed, we deny that he had any ſuch power, as is ſhewed already. This diſtinction you almoſt find <hi>in terminis, Digeſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. <hi>l</hi> 2. where <hi>Pomponius</hi> words are cited. This way alſo <hi>Tacitus</hi> is to be underſtood.

And it cannot be denied, but <hi>Dio</hi> approveth that ſame Law. So do all king-flatterers. Yet <hi>Dion, lib</hi> 51. ſaith, That this Law was enacted firſtly in favour of <hi>Octavius.</hi> And no wonder: for he ſubdued and overcame all that ſtood by the liberties and priviledges of the people. But the Conquerour may rule at random, as is often ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. So <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> having ſubdued the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> obtained the like priviledge, not only to themſelves, but alſo to their ſucceſſours. In ſuch a caſe we deny not, but kings have had an abſolute and arbitrary power. But though <hi>Auguſtus</hi> obtained this priviledge, yet ſure I am, the Dictatours had it not, as is ſhewed already.</p>

Such Kings do not judge according to the Law of the Kingdom. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there power according to the Law of the Kindom laid upon ſuch. What they do is done by themſelves unanſwerable to any. They act
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114526:71"/>
will-way, and not Law-way. They were not judged, becauſe they did take power to themſelves above all Law. It cannot be denied but <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> concludeth well from 1 <hi>Son.</hi> 8. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. that the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> judged. <hi>Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 2. But he will do well to advert, that though this be true <hi>Rex judicat,</hi> concerning the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to God's inſtitution, the Law of the Nation, and the practice of ſome of their Kings, yet this is as true <hi>Rex non judicat,</hi> concerning the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Kings. And it is very obſervable, that <hi>Jannoeus,</hi> whom they called <hi>Alexander,</hi> all the while he did reign over the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> acted nothing according to Law, but tyrannized over them, <hi>foſ. ant.

But in <hi>Gem. tract. de Syned.) cap.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, that becauſe of <hi>Jannoeus,</hi> it was enacted, that the king ſhould neither judge, nor be judged. And if it be true that it was enacted then, then do I not think that it was upon that fabalous ground, (which doth not ſo much as reliſh to <hi>Salmaſius</hi>) of which the <hi>Rabbinick writers</hi> ſpeak, but becauſe of the tyranny and cruelty of the man, who did not govern law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but will-way. And as <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo the tyrant <hi>Herod</hi> had an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, though we ſuppoſe it did depend much from the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Antonius, Joſ.

                     <hi>Concluſ 3.</hi> The good Kings of the <hi>Jews</hi> becauſe of perſonall endowments, had exemption and immunity from Law.</p>
                  <p>This is manifeſt in the examples of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> There were two things chiefly in <hi>David</hi> which were againſt the Law. 1. Multrpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of wives. Whereof <hi>David</hi> had very many, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 3. and 14.2. Murder upon the back of adultery, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. And <hi>Solomon</hi> did many things contrary to the Law 1. He multiplied gold and ſilver. 2. Horſes and Charets. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.3. Wives. And 4 he fell into adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11. And yet we read no that either <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> were judged therefore by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And what (I pray you) could be the reaſon of this? Not becauſe the king <hi>de jure</hi> hathimmunity from Law. Nor becauſe they over-awed the Sanhedrin by force of armes. We read nothing of that. And you ſhall not make me believe, that the Sanhedrin durſt not attempt the executing of juſtice upon them. 1. You thereby put a great note of reproach upon <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> You do no leſſe then inſinuate a diſpoſition in them for rebellion, if you alleadge that the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin, which <hi>de jure</hi> (as both already and afterward doth appear) had power over them, durſt not for fear of their reſiſtance, execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them. That had been a diſpoſition to reſiſt the higer powers. Which the Holy Ghoſt condemneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. And I will not think that ſuch men had the Spirit of rebellion to repine againſt the execution of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. 2. We find that the Sanhedrin did execute juſtice on <hi>Amaziah.</hi> And the people did ſo againſt. <hi>Athaliah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 23. Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me think that it was not for want of power, that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:114526:72"/>
were ſpared. Other Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were puniſhed for their faults. The Sanhedrin and people had power to execute juſtice on them. And why not alſo on <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon?</hi> They were all Kings alike. And it is very remarkable that after <hi>Solomon's</hi> death, ten tribes declined the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Solomon's</hi> heavy exactions and tributes he laid upon the people, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 10. I believe they were as powerfull to revolt from <hi>Solomon</hi> as from <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> And ſeing the people took ſo heavily with <hi>Solomon's</hi> yoke, that therefore they did revolt from his ſon, it maketh me think that the Sanhedrin did not ſpare him for fear of his power. Verily both they and the people have born patiently with his ſlips and heavy impoſitions, becauſe of his rare and ſingular qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Otherwiſe I can ſee nothing for it, why the people did not make a mutiny againſt, and revolt from <hi>Solomon</hi> as againſt, and from <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam.</hi> 3. Becauſe, as both already and afterward doth appear, the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin, both according to GOD's inſtitution, and the Law of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had authority and juriſdiction above the king. But ſure I am it had been a very uſeleſſe power if they durſt not have exerciſed it. It had been all one to have wanted that authority, with wanting power to have put it in execution as occaſion ſerved. And this had been a having, and a non-having power. Which is ridiculous and repugnant. Neither can you alleadge that they were ſpared, becauſe then judicatories were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together turned corrupt, and knew not what it was to exerctſe juſtice: for that doth directly militate againſt the eminent Reformation both of Church and State, that was under the reign of both theſe Kings. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were ſpared, not becauſe they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, nor becauſe the people durſt not execute judgement on them, nor becauſe the people and judicatories under their reign were altogether diſſolute, not knowing the way of exerciſing juſtice; to me it is more then manifeſt that their delinquency was paſt-by, becauſe of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall endowments. The ſhining vertues and eminent graces that did appear in them, no queſtion have kept back the Sanhedrin from putting hand on them O! what a temptation would it be to me, to voice for a <hi>David's</hi> off-cutting? O! how much would my ſoul be grieved to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt a <hi>Solomon?</hi> And ſhall not I think but thoſe of the Sanhedrin were much taken up with the qualifications of theſe men, as well as I could be with the vertues of ſuch-like? I cannot think that I am ſingular in this.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>interim</hi> obſerve, that my meaning is not that they had ſuch a vaſt power as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> dreameth of. I do not think that ever the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin would have ſpared them, unleſſe they could not have done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, if they had turned poſitive and even-down tyrants and deſtroyers of the Commonwealth. But onely my meaning is, that becauſe of their eminent qualifications, they had immunity from Law in ſome notes of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114526:72"/>
delinquency. Neither do I ſpeak, that they had this priviledge, <hi>de jure,</hi> but <hi>de facto.</hi> Thus you ſee that this is no argument for Royalliſts, who object, the Sanhedrin's ſparing of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a ground of the King's arbitrary power: And in this none is more ready then <hi>Salmaſius, Def. Reg. cap. 5.</hi> But they ſhall do well ſhortly to obſerve theſe things. 1. They were ſpared, becauſe of their perſonal endowments. They were extraordinary men: Therefore they were extraordinarily priviledged: They got an inch to the yard, and piece beyond common. Now <hi>ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinariis, ad ordinaria, non eſt ſequela.</hi> 2. It cannot be denied, but they got a diſpenſation for ſome points of delinquency. But Royalliſts have to prove, that they poſitively tyrannized over the Commonwealth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it, and not withſtanding had exemption and immunity from law. This I am ſure they can never make good. 3 This ſpeaketh ſomething of the exemption of Kings from Law, <hi>de facto.</hi> But Royalliſts, when they have ſaid this, have as yet to prove, that this <hi>factunt</hi> is <hi>de jure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inſt. <hi>O, but,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>de jure,</hi> David (<hi>and if he, then alſo</hi> Solomon, <hi>and all other kings beſide) had immunity from Law for he ſaith, Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, Pſal.</hi> 51. And they take this to be the meaning of the place; as if <hi>David</hi> had been ſubject to none but to God. And for this namely they cite <hi>Ambroſe, in Apolog. Dav. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 7. See <hi>Deus &amp; Rex,</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius, def. reg. cap.</hi> 3. But this is the main prop that all Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts have for ſetting-up the arbitrary and lawleſs power of the King.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall not ſtand here to repeat the judgment of Interpreters. Our learned and dear Countryman, <hi>Lex Rex, quoeſt.</hi> 26. of this ſpeaketh abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. But in few words I expound the words thus. They are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <gap reason="foreign">

No queſtion, they are to be conſidered in an hyperbolick ſenſe. They muſt not be taken in an excluſive, but in an incluſive notion. Juſt ſo as are theſe words, <hi>I [am] the LORD, and [there is] none elſe, Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Otherwiſe it ſhould follow, that there were no creature beſide the Creator, and no other thing beſide the LORD. And yet it is known, that there are Angels, men, and many other creatures. Therefore their ſenſe is meerly figurative and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolick, pointing-out the eminency of GOD's eſſence. Even ſo <hi>David</hi> thereby aggravateth his grief for his offence done againſt the LORD. He only repeateth his ſin done againſt GOD. But he ſpeaketh nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, as it was done againſt <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> and <hi>Uriah.</hi> No reaſon can be given for this, but becauſe it more grieved him, that he had offended God then man. And ſo, as a man only taken-up with thoughts of guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and miſcarriage in order to God, he only harpeth upon that ſtring: As a man over-charged with ſorrow for ſin done againſt God, can take no time to think upon his offence to man. So <hi>David</hi> carrieth himſelf juſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114526:73"/>
ſo here. And yet it cannot be denied but he ſinned both againſt <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah</hi> and <hi>Uriah.</hi> Otherwiſe, in ſo far as he committed adultery with the one, and murder againſt the other, in ſo far he did not ſin. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he was excuſable both before God and man. Where there is no ſin, there is no Law. Our godly and dear Country-man would fain put a fair conſtruction upon <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſaying, that his meaning is, There was none above <hi>David, de facte, ibid.</hi> But the ſimple truth is. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is altogether of <hi>Salmaſius</hi> opinion. <hi>Rex unique er at,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nullis ipſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus tenebatur, &amp;c.</hi> Any man that ſpeaketh ſo plain language to this purpoſe as he doth, 'tis but loſt travel, to gloſſe it: But if we compare <hi>Ambroſe's</hi> practice with his judgment, we will find the one contrary to the other.

Dare he ſay, That under the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament remiſſion of ſins unto life eternal was not centred upon Chriſt, and acquired by him? Hath this man a face to Aeny Chriſt to be the Redeemer of Beleevers under the Law? By whoſe mediation I pray you did they paſs from death to life, if not by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, who is the only Advocat before the Father for the ſins of all the Elect? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, thoſe who were under the Law beleeved in Chriſt, who was to be incarnated, and who was about to ſhed his blood on the Croſſe for the Redemption of Beleevers. But doth this take-away Chriſt's blood ſhed under the now Teſtament, as the ground and center of Salvation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to Beleevers under the old Teſtament? Howſoever, ſure I am, this Gentleman cannot deny, but under the old Teſtament God only could pardon ſin. Now this Authour, whom he calleth an ignorant and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114526:73"/>
peſtilent knave, ſaith no more but this. And I ſhall let any indifferent Reader judge between <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and him, whether or not <hi>Salmaſius</hi> hath reaſon to rail ſo much againſt him, becauſe he ſaith. That under the old Teſtament GOD only could pardon <hi>David's</hi> ſin. Oh! that this poor wretch is not aſhamed to ſpeak ſo blaſphemouſly. This truth is old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and can ſpeak for it ſelf. And ſure I am, there is no honeſt heart who will allow <hi>Salmaſius</hi> in this.</p>
                  <p>Royalliſts need not to brag much, becauſe <hi>David</hi> was unpuniſhable by man, for his murder and adultery. Arguing from this, the ſtate of the Queſtion between us and them is changed. And thus the Queſtion is moved, <hi>Whether or not a man according to God's own heart, one worth ten thouſand, and as in qualification, ſo in ſtation, above every one of the People, ſhould be cut-off and puniſhed by the State, for committing adultery with a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat woman, and committing murder againſt a privat man?</hi> And what if I ſhould hold the negative of the Queſtion, (as indeed I make it a great caſe, and do ſpare to determine upon either of the parts at this time; yet would Royalliſts gain juſt nothing? The Queſtion between them and us is this: <hi>Whether or not the King is unpuniſhable by man, though turned a poſitive tyrant, and forthwith a deſtroyer of the Commonwealth?</hi> Friends, ſhew me the like practice in <hi>David,</hi> and the Sanhedrin's ſparing him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and I ſhall yeeld to you.

The Gematick Writers from theſe words, <hi>Ob, houſe of</hi> David,—<hi>execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the band of the oppreſſour, Jerem.</hi> 21. move this Queſtion, <hi>Niſi in jus vocari póſſent, quomodo judicarent?</hi> i. e. How could the houſe of <hi>David</hi> judge, unleſſe they were judged? This they prove, becauſe in Scripture we are commanded to ſearch and try our wayes, <hi>i.e.</hi> as they ſay, <hi>Corrige te ipſum, deinde alios corrige. Salmaſius</hi> rageth at this, and he denieth what they infer. I ſhall not take it upon me to make good their conſequences. Let <hi>Salmaſius</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn them as much as he will. My purpoſe is only to ſhew. That they are not of his opinion. They are contented not only to ſay, That the king of the <hi>Jews,</hi> at-leaſt of <hi>Judah,</hi> (as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf out of <hi>Sichardus</hi> &amp; R. <hi>Lakiſes</hi> hath) was ſubjected to Law, but alſo they diſpute for that, and endeavour to enforce it by Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from their acting with the concurrence of their Princes: <hi>And
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114526:74"/>
David conſulted with the Captains of thouſands, and hundreds, [and] with every leader. And</hi> David <hi>ſaid uuto all the Congregation of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>If it [ſeem] good unto you,let us ſend abroad unto our brethren,that they may gather themſelves unto us,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. There is much in this, <hi>If it ſeem good unto you.</hi> This inſinuateth that as <hi>David</hi> would not act without the advice and counſel of his people, ſo his acting depended from their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>For the King had taken counſel, and his Prieſts, and all the Congregation in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to keep the Paſs-over in the ſecond moneth.</hi> He doth it not of his own head without advice. <hi>And the thing pleaſed the King, and all the Congregation.</hi> It is a thing done by common conſent. <hi>So they eſtabliſhed a decree,</hi>—Mark, it is not ſaid, <hi>So the King eſtabliſhed a decree.</hi> But the Authority both of King and Princes is interpoſed. The decree floweth from the joynt-authority of both. Therefore it is added, <hi>So the poſts went with Letters from the King, and the Princes, 2 Chron. 30.</hi> They go not forth as commiſſioned only from the King, but alſo from the Princes. And it is moſt remarkable, that which <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſaid unto the Princes.—<hi>The King [is] not he [that] can do any thing againſt you.</hi> Jerem. 38. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if the King could do nothing againſt the will of the Princes, he had not an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power to diſpoſe upon matters as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>Inſt. <hi>The King delivered</hi> Jeremiah <hi>into the hands of the Princes</hi> (ſaith Salmaſius) <hi>not becauſe he was inferiour to them, but by way of courteſie and gratification, and perhaps for fear of ſedition.</hi> Def. reg. cap. 4. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I confeſſe <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oſephus. ant. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. doth inſinuate as much. But by your leave I muſt needs ſay, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> might have delivered <hi>Jeremiah</hi> into the hands of the Princes, whether through gratification or through jealouſie, and yet he needed not to ſay that he could do nothing againſt them. And ſure I am, if he had had an arbitrary power over them, he would never have ſaid ſo. 1. Becauſe it had been a known and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt lie. Which he would have been aſhamed to have ſpoken in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Princes. 2. He ſhould have done altogether againſt gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and wildom. Againſt gallantry, becauſe if he ſhould have denied his power by way of gratification, then ſhould he have been ſimple. And if through jealouſie, then he had been baſe and cowardly. Againſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe the high way of ſomenting ſedition, is to daſh upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition thereof. The ſeditious party is encouraged, upon the fainting and relenting of the other. Well, I do not diſpute upon what grounds <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> delivered <hi>Jeremiah</hi> into the hands of the Princes. Whether it be the one way or the other, it is not materiall. Yet you muſt give me leave to add, that you can aſſign no reaſon whether from gratification, or from jealouſie, why he ſhould have ſaid that he could do nothing againſt the will of the Princes, if he had had an arbitrary and boundleſſe power. Nay but the words are ſo clear, that they need no commentary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from the councell of the old men given to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who ſaid to him, <hi>If thou wilt be a ſervant unto this people this day, and wilt ſerve
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114526:75"/>
them, and ſpeak good words to them, then they will be thy ſervants for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 10. They perſwade the king to keep himſelf within bounds, and not to rule at randome. They would have the King to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelf as a ſervant toward the people. This is far from an arbitrary and lording power. It came to this, that either <hi>Rehoboam</hi> behoved to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to Law, and dimit of the power which his father had, although it was not boundleſſe and arbitrary, in the full vaſtneſle of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, or elſe the people would leave him and revolt from him. Thus it was not in <hi>Rehobeam</hi>'s option to leſſen or not to leſſen the yoke of his father which he held upon the peoples neck. No verily; Neither did the old men counſell him to dimit any thing of his father's power, as meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depending from his own arbitriment, but in relation to the people's deſire. And that not onely becauſe of neceſſity, but alſo becauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. Verily, the old men had been far in the wrong to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to have counſelled him to dimit any thing of his power, if he might have retained it juſtly. No neceſſity lawfully could have moved the old men to perſwade <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to dimit his power, if he had had ſuch a power of GOD, and if the defire of the people had been unhoneſt and unjuſt. No evill ſhould be done, that good may come of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Verily the young mens counſell had been more juſt and reaſonable, then the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the old men, if <hi>Rehoboam</hi> lawfully might have kept the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his fathers yoke, and if the peoples defire had been unlawfull. But it is known (as <hi>salmaſius</hi> himſelf confeſſeth) that <hi>Solomon</hi> unjuſtly keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people under heavy preſſures, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11. and the counſell of the old men was juſt and reaſonable, yea and the defire of the people was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and equitable, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 10 <hi>Lof. ant. Jud. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Now tell me, whether or not the Kings of the <hi>Jewes de jure</hi> had an arbitrary and lording power over the people? If they had ſuch a power <hi>de jure,</hi> then did the people <hi>contra jus,</hi> in deſiring <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to dimit his father's power, which at the moſt can be called nothing but abſolute and uncircumſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the old men did alſo <hi>contra jus,</hi> in defiring <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to ſatisfie the people's deſire. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> himſelf will not ſay ſo. But he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the peopl's deſire was juſt, and the old mens counſell ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Yet I remit it to any indifferent reader to judge, whether or not the people could have deſired <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to leſſen the yoke of his father, and the old men could have counſelled him to ſerve the people, and ſatisfie their deſire without the note of higheſt treaſon, if he had been their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute lord? And if you deny that <hi>de jure</hi> they had any ſuch power, then do I gain the point.</p>
                  <p>Inſt. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> hath no more to ſay againſt this, But (1) <hi>they did not accuſe, condemn, and bring</hi> Rehoboam <hi>to death, as the Engliſh rebels deale with K.</hi> Charles. (2.) <hi>There is none who will not condemn</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>As an apostate and rebell, and impute rebellion to all his ſucceſſours,</hi> Def. reg. cap. 4. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a meer ſhifting of the queſtion. What is it to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114526:75"/>
purpoſe that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not accuſe, condemn, and cut-off <hi>Rehoboam?</hi> Will it therefore follow, that he had an arbitrary and lording power, or that they went not about to eclipſe his power, and to keep it within bounds? The contrary of that is ſhewed already. And I think, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will ſay, that they had not reaſon to cut-off <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> He did no more but threatned them with heavy preſſures and grievous impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that through the ſuggeſtion of wicked and evill counſell. We read not that he had tyrannized over them, and had put any thing in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he threatened them with. And yet they ſay, <hi>What portion [have] we in</hi> David? <hi>neither have we inheritance in the ſon of</hi> Jeffe. <hi>Every man to your tents O Iſrael, and now,</hi> David, <hi>ſee to thine own houſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 10. My friend, were they any thing behinde with <hi>Rehoboam</hi> in this? And I am ſure, they did as much againſt <hi>Rehoboam</hi> in revolting from him, and in ſetting another King over them, upon his threatning them with tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as if they ſhould have cut him off, if at any time he had actually exerciſed tyranny upon them, <hi>Conſideratis conſiderandis,</hi> the caſe is juſt one. They declined him upon his profeſſion of tyranny. And I pray, imagine you but they would have dealt far more roughly with him, if he had put it in action? Did they not ſtone <hi>Adoram</hi> to death, who was ſent out by the King to them? And was not the King conſtrained to flee to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for fear of his life, after they had revolted from him? Yea, were they not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a poſture to have withſtood the King, if he had come againſt them in arms? 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. &amp; 13.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. I cannot ſtand here to diſpute, whether or not they did lawfully revolt from him. But ſure I am, I may very juſtly determine upon either of theſe two. 1. That <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> was a vile idolater, and was not worthy to be a King. 2. That the people juſtly defired <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to dimit of the power which his father had, and that the old men did arightly counſel <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to do ſo. Neither of theſe doth <hi>Salmaſius</hi> deny. And ſo I gain the point, as is already proved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> proceſſing their Kings. So did they againſt <hi>Athaliah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. and <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. See <hi>ſubſect.</hi> 2. <hi>prop.</hi> 1. And as they proceſſed their Kings, ſo did they reſiſt them, as afterward is ſhewed. But I pray you, could they have done ſuch things lawfully if their Kings had had an arbitrary power over them? And that they did ſuch things according to Law and Reaſon is proved by us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly: If <hi>Ahab</hi> had had an abſolute power, I ſee no reaſon how he could have been refuſed of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. Sure I am, if he had had a prerogative above Law, and a power to diſpoſe according to his pleaſure, either upon the goods or the perſon of the ſubject, he might have taken <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard at his own hand, without ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it with <hi>Naboth</hi>'s leave. And yet the text ſaith, That <hi>Naboth</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving refuſed to give it him, he went home much diſmaid, and refuſed to eat bread, becauſe <hi>Naboth</hi> had denied it to him. And, which is more, he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114526:76"/>
could not get it till a falſe proceſſe was led againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> by the craſt of Jezebel. But is it imaginable that ever ſuch things would have been done, if <hi>Ahab</hi>'s power had been arbitrary and uncircumſcribed? No verily. No queſtion, if his power had been boundleſſe, by vertue of a Royal Act he might have taken <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, either without grieving himſelf, or without leading a falſe proceſſe againſt <hi>Naboth.</hi> And therefore Mr. <hi>Withers; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </q> Now hereby is made to appear. That the Kings of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, whether according to the Law of God, or the Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And why then do Royalliſts plead ſo much for the King's arbitrary power, ſeing the <hi>Jewiſh Kings, de jure,</hi> had it not? Which maketh me think other Kings far leſſe ſhould have it: for the ordination of the <hi>Jewiſh Kings</hi> did depend from God in a moſt ſpecial way and God there in was moſt intimatly concerned. We muſt not think, that the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> after the captivity, <hi>de jure,</hi> had any priviledge above Law, more then thoſe who preceded them. According to the Law of God they had no ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, as is ſhewed already. And that according to the Law of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had it not, is alſo evident. (1.) Becauſe after the captivity the ſtore of the Government was changed. And they had not ſo much as

I confeſſe, whileas <hi>Herod</hi> was cited before the Sanhedrin, he was not King but Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Galilee.</hi> But what then? I hope <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will not deny (which indeed he confeſſes) that his father <hi>Antipater</hi> did reign as King. And yet the Elders of the People did accuſe him before <hi>Hyrcanus.</hi> But neither <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> who indeed was King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor <hi>Antipater,</hi> who was Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and managed the matters of the Kingdom becauſe of his weakneſs, were able to abſolve <hi>Herod,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Syria,</hi> wrote ſome Letters to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> threatning him, if he did not abſolve him.

So that <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> was neceſſitate, in ſatisfying <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s deſire, to cauſe <hi>Herod</hi> flee quietly away. Now, I would fain know of <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> if either <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> or <hi>Antipater</hi> had had an abſolute and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, might they not have abſolved <hi>Herod</hi> at their pleaſure, the Sannedrin nilling, or willing, and not baſely for fear of the Sanhedrin have diſmiſſed <hi>Herod</hi> ſecretly? Therefore <hi>Salmaſius</hi> muſt give me leave to ſay, (though he imagineth the contrary) that <hi>Sichardus</hi> very pertinently urgeth this example, to prove, that the power of the Sanhedrin was above the King.

And ſo you muſt after the ſame manner expound the words which are added to theſe. And for my ſelf I take this expoſition of his to be meer non-ſenſe. And ſure I am, there is no Humaniſt, who according to the rules of true Rhetorick, can admit ſuch an expoſition. I ſee he will have <hi>Rex,</hi> taken in an ambiguous ſenſe. But I know not if ever he read, that one and the ſame word in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuate Oration, is taken under divers ſenſes. Such cryptick expreſſions become not Humaniſts, but Sophiſts, &amp; Amphibologick Prophets. Well, we have given the ſenſe of theſe words already, in this ſame Section, <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. And we mind no more to ſtand here, but only put <hi>Salmaſius</hi> in mind of this, That the Kings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether according to the Law of God, or the Law of man, had no prerogative royal above Law: <hi>Ergo</hi> far leſſe any other Kings are ſo priviledged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly:</hi> Abſolute power, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> is a tvrannick power: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not a lawful power and a power from God. The <hi>Antecedent</hi> cannot be denied, becauſe abſolute and arbitrary power putteth the King, or any inveſted therewith, in a diſpoſition for, and capacity of acting either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, or contrary to Law, of tyrannizing, and non-tyrannizing over the People. Now this aptitude of arbitrary power is the very <hi>adus primus</hi> thereof. The conſequence is alſo undeniable: for God cannot be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any evil and tyrannous power. Power, in ſo far as it is tyrannous in as far it is ſinful and unlawful, either in leſſe or more. The Scripture of God crieth-down tyranny, and ſo doth the very Law of Nature. But who will ſay, That God hath hand in any thing that is evil and unjuſt; unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe he will not be aſhamed to ſay, That God is the author of ſin? And if it be ſo, that abſolute and arbitrary power is not of God, I admire how Malignants are not aſhamed to plead ſo much for it.</p>
                  <p>The point being thus eſtabliſhed from Scripture, and reaſon ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon, the next thing we have to do in this buſineſſe, is to ſhew, that it is not onely my judgement, but even that alſo which the very light of Nature taught <hi>Ethnicks</hi> to embrace. <hi>Herodot</hi> approveth <hi>Pindarus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he called Law the King and Lord of every thing, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. And <hi>lib.</hi> 7. he ſaith, that amongſt the <hi>Lacedamonians</hi> Law was King. In like manner
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114526:77"/>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> approveth <hi>Pindarus</hi> for that ſame, <hi>comment, in Princ. Plato</hi> doth much cry-up <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> becauſe he prevented tyranny, in chooſing ſome to govern with him in the Kingdom, and made Law King. So that (ſaith he) Law became the King of men, and not men the Kings of Law, <hi>In epiſt. ad famil. Dion.</hi> And in the politicks he ſaith, We ſhould not call the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and kingly power abſolute. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reproveth arbitrary power in the <hi>Lacedemonian Ephorie,</hi> and in plain terms ſaith, that it had done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to judge according to Law, then according to it's own will, <hi>Polit.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. And <hi>Polit.</hi> 4. <hi>cap</hi> 4. he ſaith in even-down termes, that Law ought to rule all. Which maketh him ſay, that where Law doth not lord, there is not a Republick. Yea <hi>cap.</hi> 5. he calleth abſolute optimacy, tyranny, calling it all one with the tyranny of kingly government. <hi>Pol.</hi> 5 <hi>cap.</hi> 10 he differenceth the tyrant from the King in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the object of the King is <hi>honeſtum,</hi> and of the tyrant, <hi>quod placet.</hi> Thus he maketh <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his <hi>cui quod libet licet,</hi> the propriety of a Tyrant, not of a King. And therefore ſhutting-up the whole matter in a word, he calleth all powers above Law meer tyrannies. But you ſhall not need to imagine that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this contradicteth himſelf, whileas <hi>Pol.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. &amp; 12, he alloweth pambaſilick monarchy. 1. Becauſe, as is above ſaid, there is great difference between <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. And already we have ſhewed that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth not abſolutely, but comparatively op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe government laid upon one governing <hi>ex voluntate,</hi> to government mannaged and carried-on <hi>ſecundum legem.</hi> 2. It is far from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s mind to diſpute ſimply and abſolutely for ſuch a power. But his main purpoſe is to diſpute againſt theſe who deny pambaſilick and all-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning monarchy to be according to Nature. And it cannot be denied, but both mixed and unmixed monarchy are naturall, albeit arbitrary and unlimited regall power be againſt the very Law of Nature it ſelf. It is no wonder though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeak ſomething for Royall power. Had he not <hi>Alexander</hi> to deal-with, who could endure none to govern but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Church-Prophets or rather prating paraſites, ſuch as are the lying ſpirits, and King-flatterers now a-dayes, were they as great Courtiers as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was, I trow they ſhould not be aſhamed, in plain language and poſitive terms to prefer the King to CHRIST. The Ethnicks called <hi>Jupiter primus.</hi> But they could find in their heart to change that, and ſay, <hi>Caeſar primus.</hi> Tell not me that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is for abſolute and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed monarchy. Compare place with place, and you will finde the contrary. Yea, <hi>Polit.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. he layeth down this as a ground. That Monarchy tranſgreſſing the right model, is againſt Nature it ſelf: But ſure I am, a power to tyrannize and act againſt Law, is againſt the right model: for both <hi>in actu primo,</hi> and <hi>actu ſecun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is far from taking-in arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power. And, which is more, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſo far from allowing arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114526:78"/>
Monarchy, that, as afterward is ſhewed, no Government taked ſo much room in his heart as Deinocracy.

               <p>AS in the former Queſtion we have offered our judgment very freely, ſo ſhall we do the like here. And that we may do ſo to ſome purpoſe and diſtinctly, we offer our judgment to you in theſe Aſſertions.</p>
               <p>Aſſert. 1. <hi>Royal power,</hi> ectypically, <hi>is the choiceſt of Governments,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is to be taken two wayes. 1. In order to the Creatour. It cannot be denied, but Monarchy <hi>ectypically</hi> and by way of aſſimilation commeth neareſt to the Government of God, and doth livelieſt ropreſent it: for the Divine Eſſence is ſimply one, admitting no diverſity. Now, a thing is no otherwiſe good and pure, but as it is ſquared according to the perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Divine Eſſence. And conſequently Monarchy having a more intimat aſſimilation to the Divine Eſſence then any other Government, <hi>ectypically</hi> and by way of aſſimilation, it cannot but be the chiefeſt of Governments. This breaketh the neck of all that is objected from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance that is between Regal Government, and the Government of God, to prove Monarchy to be the choiceſt of Governments. So do ſome object expreſly, <hi>Iſoc. Nic.

               <p>2. In order to the Creature. We find, that both amongſt inanimate, and animate creatures, a natural kind of Monarchy is obſerved. Is there not in the complex body of the Univerſe one above all the reſt? We ſee the Heaven is above all the four Elements.

               </p>
               <p>In clearing this, you ſhall obſerve with me, theſe three times. 1. The golden time. 2. The heroick time. 3. The non-heroick and after-time. As for the golden time, it cannot be denied, but people then had only a diſpoſition for natural and oeconomick government. See <hi>ſubſect.</hi> 2. <hi>concl.</hi> 3. But the heroick time did extreamly encline to Monarchick Government. Before the flood Giants and men of renown did enlarge their power, and brought all in ſubjection to them. After the flood about 131 years, <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> began to erect a Kingdom for himſelf. And afterward the heads of Colonies went forth, and eſtabliſhed Kingdoms. At that time heroick ſpirits one way or other came to Crowns. Of this is ſpoken already by us at large: We ſhall not now need to repeat any thing we ſpoke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the extraordinary, or ordinary Heroes. That time had ſuch a diſpoſition for Regal Government, that it carried the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſeek a King, whether God would or not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. We find very reaſon for it, why then the diſpoſition of people did moſt intenſively carry them toward that kind of Government. 1. Becauſe men then were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: They were then more prodigal then politick. There could be found at that time few or no Commonwealth's-men. And to this very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeth that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Polit.</hi> 3, <hi>cap,</hi> 11, &amp; <hi>Pol.</hi> 4 <hi>cap,</hi> 13, ſaying, That Kingly Government was in the beginning becauſe then men were ignorant, and few Commonwealth'ſ-men could be found. I confeſs, his meaning is mainly concerning the golden age: And in reſpect of it he alſo ſpeaketh true. No queſtion, then every thing was but in its beginning: Men then were but acquainted with the rudiments of learning and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſcarcely that. Any Government they had then was not Politick, but Natural and oeconomick: At leaſt, it did not much differ therefrom. And it muſt needs be ſaid, That then people were not acquainted with the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114526:79"/>
Rules of Policy in the Heroick age. It cannot be denied, but in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick time men had greater inſight and experience then in the Golden time. In the heroick age Policy began to have footing. And no queſtion at the end thereof men were better acquainted therewith, then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. Their experience and inſight then could not but be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet we muſt needs ſay, that comparing the age of Heroiciſm with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times, men in it were but meanly acquainted with the Rules of Policy. As far as the herock time therein exceeded the golden time, ſo far therein did after-times exceed the heroick time. And we find that alwaies the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times do abound more in Learning and Policy, then the preceding and former. 2. Becauſe in thoſe dayes men were of a gigantine ſtrength and vaſt courage. Then they were much given to warlike exploits, to the building of Cities, and to the enlarging of their own dominions. What I pray you then could be more ſuitable to the diſpoſition of men then King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government? Prodigality was then more ſtood-by then Policy. Then men were alwaies ſet a-work on haughty and heroick deſignments. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not be governed and ordered, but by ſuch who were far above their reach. What? did not then the haughtineſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cry for a King? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. They tell <hi>samuel,</hi> they will have a King as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And this is as much as if they had ſaid, We cannot endure to be inſeriour to other Nations. And therfore we will have a King. What was it I pray you, that made <hi>Nimrod</hi> to take Royal Power to himſelf, but becauſe he was a mighty hunter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. one of an haughty and arrogant diſpoſition? Pride of heart, and arrogancy of ſpirit would not admit <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> to be <hi>Pompey</hi>'s equal, and <hi>Pompey Caeſar</hi>'s ſuperiour. <hi>Lib. dec.</hi> 14. <hi>Luc. dn. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Plut. de Pomp.</hi> The very inſtinct of Nature doth abundantly teach, Kingly Government moſt to beſeem the diſpoſition and temper of the proud and haughty. Cranes, and Bees, which Nature hath taught to erect amongſt them Kingly Government, in haughtineſs and proudneſſe amongſt all beaſts are matchleſſe, <hi>Apol. in hierogl. lib.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Virg. Geor.</hi> 4. <hi>Plm. nat. hist. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Juv. Sat.</hi> 13. <hi>Ambr. hex. lib.</hi> 5. Is it any wonder then though in the heroick age men did much dote upon Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then men were extream haughty and arrogant, and could not be governed by equals. They were much given to high and lofty underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. And what could expede them therein more then Kings? In after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I deny not but Monarchy did go much out of requeſt, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the non-heroick with the heroick time. This maketh <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. That in after-times the kingly power was extreamly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, partly by the King's dimitting thereof, and partly by the People's detracting therefrom. This is already illuſtrated by us, by manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. No wonder that this was: for as the heroick age in Policy did exceed the golden age, ſo therein after-times did exceed the heroick times, yea much more. Thence was it, men then ſo abounded in Learning and Policy, that in many Commonwealths they could endure no Kings at all.</p>

               <p>In clearing this, you ſhall obſerve with me, theſe three times. 1. The golden time. 2. The heroick time. 3. The non-heroick and after-time. As for the golden time, it cannot be denied, but people then had only a diſpoſition for natural and oeconomick government. See <hi>ſubſect.</hi> 2. <hi>concl.</hi> 3. But the heroick time did extreamly encline to Monarchick Government. Before the flood Giants and men of renown did enlarge their power, and brought all in ſubjection to them. After the flood about 131 years, <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> began to erect a Kingdom for himſelf. And afterward the heads of Colonies went forth, and eſtabliſhed Kingdoms. At that time heroick ſpirits one way or other came to Crowns. Of this is ſpoken already by us at large: We ſhall not now need to repeat any thing we ſpoke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the extraordinary, or ordinary Heroes. That time had ſuch a diſpoſition for Regal Government, that it carried the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſeek a King, whether God would or not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. We find very reaſon for it, why then the diſpoſition of people did moſt intenſively carry them toward that kind of Government. 1. Becauſe men then were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: They were then more prodigal then politick. There could be found at that time few or no Commonwealth's-men. And to this very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeth that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap,</hi> 11, &amp; <hi>Pol.</hi> 4 <hi>cap,</hi> 13, ſaying, That Kingly Government was in the beginning becauſe then men were ignorant, and few Common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

No queſtion, then everything was but in its beginning: Men then were but acquainted with the rudiments of learning and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſcarcely that. Any Government they had then was not Politick, but Natural and oeconomick: At leaſt, it did not much differ therefrom. And it muſt needs be ſaid, That then people were not acquainted with the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114526:80"/>
Rules of Policy in the Heroick age. It cannot be denied, but in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick time men had greater inſight and experience then in the Golden time. In the heroick age Policy began to have footing. And no queſtion at the end thereof men were better acquainted therewith, then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. Their experience and inſight then could not but be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet we muſt needs ſay, that comparing the age of Heroiciſm with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times, men in it were but meanly acquainted with the Rules of Policy. As far as the herock time therein exceeded the golden time, ſo far there in did after-times exceed the heroick time. And we find that alwaies the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times do abound more in Learning and Policy, then the preceding and former. 2. Becauſe in thoſe dayes men were of a gigantine ſtrength and vaſt courage. Then they were much given to warlike exploits, to the building of Cities, and to the enlarging of their own dominions. What I pray you then could be more ſuitable to the diſpoſition of men then King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government? Prodigality was then more ſtood-by then Policy. Then men were alwaies ſet a-work on haughty and heroick deſignments. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not be governed and ordered, but by ſuch who were far above their reach. What? did not then the haughtineſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cry for a King? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. They tell <hi>Samuel,</hi> they will have a King as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And this is as much as if they had ſaid, We cannot endure to be inferiour to other Nations. And therfore we will have a King. What was it I pray you, that made <hi>Nimrod</hi> to take Royal Power to himſelf, but becauſe he was a mighty hunter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. one of an haughty and arrogant diſpoſition? Pride of heart and arrogancy of ſpirit would not admit <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> to be <hi>Pompey</hi>'s equal, and <hi>Pompey Caeſar</hi>'s ſuperiour. <hi>Liv. dec.</hi> 14. <hi>Luc. dn. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Plut. de Pomp.</hi> The very inſtinct of Nature doth abundantly teach, Kingly Government moſt to beſeem the diſpoſition and temper of the proud and haughty.

Is it any wonder then though in the heroick age men did much dote upon Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then men were extream haughty and arrogant, and could not be governed by equals. They were much given to high and lofty underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. And what could expede them therein more then Kings? In after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I deny not but Monarchy did go much out of requeſt, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the non-heroick with the heroick time. This maketh <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. That in after-times the kingly power was extreamly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, partly by the King's dimitting thereof, and partly by the People's detracting therefrom. This is already illuſtrated by us, by manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. No wonder that this was: for as the heroick age in Policy did exceed the golden age, ſo therein after-times did exceed the heroick times, yea much more. Thence was it men then ſo abounded in Learning and Policy, that in many Commonwealths they could endure no Kings at all.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114526:81"/>
At laſt the number of Commonwealth's-men greatly encreaſed, till they did not leave ſo much as the name of a King, much leſſe the power. So it was amongſt the <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tians, Athenians, Cyrenians, Romans,</hi> and other Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Yet obſerve this diſtinction, there is a threefold kind of people. 1. Haughty and malignant. 2. Ignorant and ſervil. 3. Witty and politick. The firſt ſort can endure no Government but kingly. And that not only, becauſe they would be great Courtiers themſelves, and promoted to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but alſo becauſe they cannot endure to be governed by their equals. The ſecond ſort Stoically are incapable of the ſence of ſlavery, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſome deified luſtre in the King. They are ſilly, baſe, common ſpirits. And becauſe of their ſillineſſe, they are contented to live in ſlavery. And as they are baſe, ſo they are ignorant. And becauſe of their ignorance, they apprehend all their ſlaviſhneſſe abundantly to be made-up, with a glimpſe of the King's countenance: for in their deluſion, they look upon it as ſome deiſied ſpecies, apprehending him to be much more then a man. And the third ſort upon no terms can away with kingly Government. And that, becauſe they delight in freedom, and the enriching of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. We ſee, that the moſt witty and politick Kingdoms we read of, did either extreamly leſſen the power of their Kings, or elſe did ſhake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off their yoke altogether, and that both in former and after-times. So the <hi>Egyptian, Ethiopian, Indian, Athenian, Lacedemonian, Cretian, Cyrentan, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian,</hi> and <hi>Roman Kingdoms.</hi> And to day know we not, that the moſt witty and politick Kingdoms of the world, which delight in the liberty of the Subject, and wealth of the Republick, cannot away with kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? So <hi>Venice, Florence, Holland,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> What I pray you can be the reaſon, that <hi>England</hi> cannot away with kingly Government, and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſo much thirſtech after it? Speaking naturally, there can be no reaſon given, but becauſe <hi>England</hi> is a witty and politick Nation, and <hi>Scotland</hi> is not. What? doth not <hi>Ariſtotle, Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. &amp; <hi>Pol.</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 13. impute it to the ignorance and unpolitickneſs of people. that in old, they did ſet-up Kings to reign over them? And in the ſame places he ſaith, That Policy abounding, and Commonwealth's-men encreaſing, Kings were ſuffered no longer to govern. But although thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, be true. That people in after-times do not ſo much prize Monarchy, as in former times; and though even to day ſome kingdoms be leſſe diſpoſed for it then other kingdoms, having ſhaken it off altogether: yet not withſtanding, I am conſtrained to ſay, That in reſpect of the general and common diſpoſition of the people, nothing doth reliſh ſo much to them as kingly government. No wonder forſooth: for there are moe who are malignant and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deſiring to ſet their feet upon the necks of others, then are politick and witty. And beſides this the general and common ſort of people are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant and inſenſible of ſlavery. There are far more indeed of the firſt and ſecond ſort, then the third.</p>

And 'cis remarkable theſe two conditions being ſlighted the Judges were corrupt and diſſolute. But they being obſerved they were ever found holy and much ſo the good of the people. Then tell me, is it any wonder though the <hi>Jews</hi> were in a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition under Judges, then under Kings? The Judges for the moſt part were holy. They alwaies dehoried the people from prophanity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies delivered them from ſlivery &amp; at no time brought evil upon them. But the Kings for the moſt part were wicked, &amp; the contrary effects were produced by them.

               <p>We cannot paſſe-by the condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> after the captivity, as it was under Captains or Judges and as as it was under Kings. All the while they lived under Captains, their condition was moſt happy and bleſſed. Albeit at that time, now and then they were croſſed with the bondage of ſtrangers yet were they free from inteſtine jats. Their Captains did not riſe againſt them, and bring them under ſlavery, as did their Kings. Their

zeal and forwardneſſe in acting for the weal both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, are fully regeſtred in the books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nebemiah, Mace.</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Joſ. ant.

In a word, the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> under Kings being moſt deſperat, far unlike the tweetneſſe of their condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Judges, it ſpeaketh to us, That Kingly Government of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the moſt hazardous. What better fruits, I pray you, needeth any kingdom to expect at the hands of Kings, then the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſerved with at their hands?

And in ſo doing, thou ſhalt draw arguments and motives of diſſwading them from their purpoſe, from the very condition and nature of the King that ſhall reign over them. And <hi>R.

Either he here ſpeaketh of lawfull, or unlawfull power. If of lawfull power, either he deſcribeth to the people the good or the bad of it. If the good, <hi>ergo</hi> he did not proteſt againſt the power, but whereas he ſhould have diſſwaded the the people from ſeeking after it, he tacitely perſwadeth them thereto for how much more the excellency and goodneſſe of a thing is pointed-out, ſo much more it is deſired-after. And to ſay that <hi>Samuel</hi> did not diſſwade them therefrom, but perſwaded them thereto is to avouch that either he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114526:84"/>
did argue againſt himſelf, and militate againſt his own purpoſe, or elſe that he acted contrary to his Commiſſion from GOD. The LORD commanded him ſolemnly to proteſt, and diſſwade them from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He would have him to lay-out before their eyes the dangerouſneſſe of Kingly power, to ſtrike terrour in their hearts that they might forbear longer to deſire it. If you come to my hand and ſay, that the Prophet in this place onely ſpeaketh of unlawfull power, or of the bad of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power I obtain my deſire. I ſeek no more then that you ſay, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here of the abuſe, and not the uſe of Kingly power. And I trow, the abuſe of Kingly power is not the right, but the wrong of it.</p>

Becauſe God expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſolemnly to proteſt againſt the election of a King. But if the Prophet ſhould only have taxed them for incredulity, arrogancy, &amp;c. then ſhould the Lord only have given <hi>Sa nuel</hi> orders, to diſſwade them from theſe evils, in laying out before them the wickednes thereof. But the Prophet only layeth out before them the danger of Monarchy, &amp; expreſly diſſwadeth them therefrom. Who can imagin, if his main &amp; only purpoſe had been for diſſwading them from theſe evils, and not from ſetting-up Royal Government amongſt them, but he would rather have turned his Royal Government amongſt them, but he would rather have turned his face againſt theſe evils, in ſpreading-out the dangers thereof before their face, then in pointing-out to them the evil of Monarchy? Verily, were it ſo, he had harped upon the wrong ſtring. Thirdly, the people's anſwer is in reference to <hi>Samuel</hi>'s reaſoning. <hi>Nay but</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we will have a king over us.</hi> This had been a very uncategorick anſwer, yea plain non-ſenſe; if <hi>Samuel</hi> had been only taxing them for carnal confidence, arrogancy &amp;sc. and dehorting them therefrom. Fourthly, Becauſe we have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, That <hi>Samuel,</hi> according to God's Commandment, draweth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from acts of tyranny that the King would exerciſe, to diſſwade the people from ſeeking after him. Would he ſay, Ye think your King will' fight your battels, and ſave you from forrain invaſion. Well, let it be ſo. But I'll tell you the King himſelf will tyrannize over you. Get him when you will, I warrant ye ſhall not be free of inteſtine trouble. Nothing is ſo evil as that. It is worſe then ſorrain war. Therefore ye will do well to keep your ſelves free of him ſo long as ye want him. Fifthly, Whileas the Lord tacitly rebuketh them of carnal confidence, in theſe words, <hi>They have rejected Me, that I ſhould not reign over them,</hi> he likewiſe in them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth a reproof in order to their ſhaking-off the Government which he had inſtituted amongſt them. I was God's Ordinance, yea the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of its own kind. But whoſoever ſhaketh-off though the leaſt of God's Ordinances, doth ſhake-off God Himſelf. <hi>Rom,</hi> 13. I mean in a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and carnal way, delighting in change, and going from the better to the worſe. So did the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> at this time. Therfore God reproving them as rejecters of Democracy, by way of conſequence he checketh them as ſuiters of Monarchy: for he could no waies have rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them for rejecting the one, if he had not altogether allowed them in ſeeking after the other. Sixthly, They are reprehended and taxed expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſeeking after a King.—<hi>I wil' call unto the LORD,—that ye may perceive and ſee, that your wickedneſs is great which ye have done in the fight of the LORD, in asking you a King.—And all the people ſaid unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>Pray for thy ſervants, unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added to all our ſins this evil, to ask us a king.—Ye have done al this wickedneſs,</hi>—1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Let the indifferent Reader judge now, whether or not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

of GOD in theſe words doth manifeſtly reprehend them as they had ſought after a king. The Royal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſt would do well not to imagin, that theſe things do exclude the Prophet's diſſwading the people's ſeeking a king, as a king. They rather include then exclude the king in this notion. And ſo Royalliſts in propounding theſe reaſons, proceed <hi>a Diviſione.</hi> They take <hi>inadaequatum,</hi> for <hi>adaequatum,</hi> the part for the whole.</p>
               <p>But for the more ſatisfactory reſolution of the fourth particular, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether or not the Prophet doth tax the <hi>Jews,</hi> in ſeeking a King after the manner of the Nations, as they ſought a <hi>King,</hi> or as they ſought a tyrannous King? If the former, we gain the point. But the other is builded upon a miſ-ſuppoſition. 1. Becauſe it is altogether repugnant to Nature, earneſtly to thirſt after tyranny, oppreſſion and miſery. The like was never heard amongſt any people, though never ſo rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, far leſſe amongſt the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom were given the Statutes and Ordinances, and who in ſecking a King, covered their knavery with fair pretences. 2. They ſeek a King, as they ſuppoſe, to be free of tyranny, and injuſtice done by <hi>Samuel</hi>'s ſons who judged them for the time. That did ſet them a work to ſeek a King. 3. Having gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves together, in ſeeking a King from <hi>Samuel,</hi> they adde this to their diſcourſe, <hi>Thou art old.</hi> Would they ſay, not onely thy ſons oppreſs us and pervert rigliteous judgement, but even thou thy ſelf art unſit to judge us. Old age hat rendered thee unable dexterouſly to go about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of judgment. Therefore let us have a King who wil ſupply thy wants. One who will judge us juſtly as thou didſt in the time of thy youth. Let us have a King to judge us uprightly, as thou didſt and not unjuſtly as do thy ſons. Now, let any rational man judge it ſuch people who ſought a King under ſuch fair pretences, for promoving vertue, and removing vice, would ever have ſought a King to tyrannize over them.

It was not for the advantage of his ſons, but for the advantage of the people, that he condeſcended to grant their deſire. So is manifeſted already. This man is ſo malicious, that he ſpareth not to traduce GOD alſo. He alleadgeth, what God did, in keeping-back the people from following out their deſire, was to

Verily, this argueth, that God did preſer the gratification of <hi>Samuel</hi> to his own honour, and that which conduced moſt thereto, and the well-fare of his people. This Gentle-man needeth not boaſt that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Deut.</hi> 17. foretold the up-ſetting of kingly government amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> This he did not, becauſe he allowed it, and preferred it to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he firſtly inſtituted amongſt them. The LORD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Samuel</hi> to hearken to the peoples voice and condeſcend to their defire. Yet it doth not follow that God allowed it. He commanded <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> poſitively to proteſt againſt it, and diſſwade them therefrom, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the evils thereof. So <hi>Moſes</hi> through the Spirit of prediction, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly forſeeing the <hi>Jews</hi> in their ſtiff-neckednes, and pride of heart, would undoubtedly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to this day it ſerveth as a morall rule, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which the ſtructure of kingly government ſhould be ſquared. Thus the Holy Ghoſt bringeth forth a moſt good effect from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of their evil and ſiniſter purpoſe.

Sure I am this is ſpoken againſt the King, both of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> It cannot be denied, but the direct and main ſtrain of this Prophet is againſt the ten Tribes, and the Kings thereof. Yet he hinteth both at <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Kings, as occaſion ſerveth. In things common to both, he ſpeaketh of both. So he doth in the text immediatly fore-going. Sure I am both <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> had hand in ſeeking <hi>Saul</hi> to reign over them.

The Judges that are chooſed, are men qualified, vertuous and godly, able to diſcharge their truſt. And this was not onely required in inferiour Judges, but even in the higher Judges alſo, members of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin. The Seventy were <hi>wiſe men, and underſtanding, and known amongst the tribes, Deut.</hi> 1. They were not chooſed at randome, or at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.

The Holy Ghoſt faith not, The wiſe men, rich and honorable, together with the heirs of the Rulers, were appointed to govern. There is not a word of any ſuch naturall reſpect. And do you imagine that the Holy Ghoſt at any time would have paſt-by in ſilence, theſe naturall priviledges, if they had been required as neceſſary conditions in the Judges and Rulers of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> Well, is it ſo that according to the Holy Ghoſt's way, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vertuous and godly ſhould govern, and none other did bear rule in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114526:89"/>
the firſt inſtitution of the <hi>Jewiſh Commonwealth,</hi> why ſhall we imagine, but the people did bear rule amongſt them? I hope you will not ſay, that vertue and godlineſſe is not to be found amongſt the people, but amongſt the great ones. The contrary is rather true, 'Tis hard for a rich man to enter Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19, <hi>Job</hi> 32, 9.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 26, 27, 28, 29. 'Tis obſervable at this time there was but ſmall difference amongſt the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the matter of riches. The moſt they had was the gold and ſilver they had gotten from the <hi>Egyptians, Ex.</hi> 3.11, and 12. And every man and woman amonoſt them gote jewels of ſilver and gold from the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> Nay, but it was not a time of their wealth, whileas they travelled in the wilderneſs. Their condition then was very unſetled What they had then, was from hand to mouth. Any proviſion they had, was from GOD'S extraordinary furniſhing. And they were all that way a-like ſerved. And after they had entered the Land, and gotten poſſeſſion of it, we read, the Land was equally divided amongſt them, according to their Tribes and Families. They lived then as a peculiar people, claiming neerer relation one to another, then any people did. In after-ages and corrupt times they could all tell you, they all were the children and ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The neereſt bonds of Nature tied every one of them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply another's wants. And as for Titles of honour amongſt them, we read of none, till they gote Kings. Such vile and prodigall titles as to day are uſed, then were unknown. Yet obeſerve, there was a two ſold, and only a two-fold ſort of Titles amongſt them. 1. A Title of Office. And thus <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Rulers.</hi> And as by their vertue they came to be Judges and Rulers, ſo by that ſame they attained to theſe Titles of Office. Which are moſt approved and commendable, as they are moſt ordinary and uſuall. 2. A title of meer nature. Thus in the time of Judges and Captains they were called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </hi> 4.8. and 10. Theſe Titles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they had from the precedency of Nature, as the firſt-born hath from the younger. The very Law of Nature it-ſelf admitteth precedency, both in reſpect of office, and of naturall generation and priority. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe every thing ſhould be turned topſie turvie, and all ſhould run into confuſion. But you ſhall not find thorow all the Book of GOD any other ſort of titles uſed. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>King</hi> is alſo a title of office. You ſhall not ſhew me, where the Rulers of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are called Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes, Earles, Vicounts, &amp;c. Such titles, I think, came from hell, and I wiſh they may thither return Now, tell me whether or not, I have good reaſon to ſay, that the <hi>Jewiſh Commonwealth</hi> under Judges was popular and democratick? No precedency amongſt them was known then, but what either office or nature did bear them to. They knew not preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy becauſe of honour and riches, what it meaned. Any precedency amongſt them, was either from naturall generation, or from qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114526:89"/>
And none amongſt them was advanced to any place of truſt, becauſe of any natural priviledge and carnal reſpect, but becauſe of vertue and godlineſſe. And this was to be found amongſt the people. We believe, qualification hangeth not at the girdles of great men. And ſuch were not amongſt the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of the Judges. And though the Seventy were choſen out from amongſt the Judges and Officers of the people, yet doth it not follow, but they were popular: for the Rulers were choſen from amongſt the people. And ſo the Seventy being of the Rulers, it neceſſarily followeth, that they were choſen from among the people. It will never conclude, that they were not popular Governours, but that afterward they were advanced to an higher degree of office, then they were formerly. The Sanhedrin was entruſted with the management of the moſt publick and greateſt matters.</p>
               <p>2. It is ſaid, <hi>Thouſhalt provide out of all the people able men,—And</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>choſe able men out of all</hi> Iſrael,—Ex. 18. There is a <hi>noble emphaſis</hi> in <hi>all,</hi> or in <hi>all Iſrael.</hi> Mark the vaſtneſſe and latitude thereof. It is not ſaid, Judges were choſen from amongſt the rich and honorable of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> That indeed had inſinuated the reſtriction of places of office and truſt to the rich and honourable. Blood-reſpect and natural ties had been neceſſary conditions in the chooſing of Judges, if that had been ſaid. But the word <hi>all,</hi> a note of univerſality, doth exempt none therefrom. It declareth, all and every one of the people, without exception, who were vertuous and godly, and fit for the diſcharge of publick truſt, ſecluding all natural ties and priviledges, to be capable of official power. Indeed, you need not take <hi>all,</hi> in a reſtricted ſenſe: for at this time they had none incloſing rich men, worldly worms, and vain-gloriouſly honourable. They knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the priority of Nature, and the precedency of Vertue. And if you call not this Popular Government, I know not what you call Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Howſoever, let me have this, and I crave no better.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it is alleadged, <hi>Moſes, Jeſhua,</hi> and the other Judges, did reign as Kings, we ſhall ſhortly demonſtrate to you what power they had. Therefore ſhortly obſerve theſe Concluſions.</p>
               <p>Concluſ. 1. Moſes, <hi>before the counſel of</hi> Jethro, <hi>had a Kingly Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is more then manifeſt. Ever till then <hi>Moſes</hi> governed all, and none but he. <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. This he did, not becauſe he delighted to lord over the people, and that none ſhould rule but he. 'Tis known, that he reſted not contented with what Rulers he had appointed at the deſire and counſell of <hi>Jethro.</hi> He intreated the Lord to appoint other Rulers, to bear bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with him. <hi>Num.</hi> 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. Neither will I ſay, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> out of meer ſimplicity and ignorance, before <hi>Jethro</hi>'s counſel, did forbear to ſet any Rulers over the people beſide himſelf. The very light of Nature taught him, that help was good, and that he alone was not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all the buſineſſes of the people. But I conceive, he did it upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds. He knew that the people of Iſrael were the Lord's peculiar
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114526:90"/>
people, whom he had brought out of Egypt extraordinarily, and over whom he had ſet him in an extraordinary way. Yea he waited for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the people, at the very mouth of the Lord. What Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances he delivered to the people, and what judgment he executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, were done according to extraordinary and immediat reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from the Lord. Which maketh me think, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance taking the word from God's mouth, and depending from his immediate revelation wholly waited upon God's Oracle, where, and when, one way or other, ſhould be revealed to him how, and what Judges ſhould be appointed to rule with him. And ſo he perceiving <hi>Jethro</hi>'s counſel to be wholeſome and from the Lord, and that God had employed him as an inſtrument of accompliſhing his expectation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought good not to deſpiſe it, but ſpeedily to embrace it. So we ſee, he wholly caſteth the election of the Seventy over upon God, and therein only taketh the word at his mouth. <hi>Num.</hi> 11, <hi>Deut</hi> 1. Albeit <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> all this while did reign as King, yet doth it make nothing for Kingly Government. 1. Becauſe he was the Lord's extraordinary Lieutenant. He was extraordinarily and immediatly deſigned by God to the charge. And to ſpeak properly and preciſely, in a politick notion, not <hi>Moſes,</hi> but God himſelf was their King. What <hi>Moſes</hi> did was by an immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency from the Lord. He took the word at God's mouth. He enquired of God judgment, and was for the people to God-ward. <hi>Ex.</hi> 18. He was as God's mouth to the people. God employed him to deliver his Laws and Ordinances to the people, becauſe they were afraid the Lord ſhould ſpeak to them. They could not without fear behold his glory and terrour. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. And <hi>Moſes</hi> finding that his charge immediatly and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily depended from the Lord, therfore he waited upon God, till he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted one way or other, where, when, and how other Governours ſhould be deſigned to rule with him over the people. And thus all the while he did govern alone, not he, but God properly and in a politick notion was their King: for he did nothing to the people but by a ſpecial, extraordinary, and immediat dependency from the Lord. 2. Till in and about the time of <hi>Jethro</hi>'s counſel, there was no fit time to create Rulers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the people. All the while before they were in a chaſed &amp; moſt unſetled condition. In which time <hi>Moſes</hi> did reign through meet neceſſity and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the times. He did rule alone, becauſe the caſe of the times ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was King, <hi>per accidens,</hi> and not <hi>per ſe.</hi> 3. Although <hi>Moſes</hi> had had an abſolute and arbitrary power over the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet would it plead no whit for Kingly Government. By manifold and moſt eminent obligations they were tied to him. For their ſake he refuſed to be called the ſon of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter, preſerring affliction with them, to all the pleaſures and pomp of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court. He conducted them thorow the Red Sea, he was as the mouth of God to them, and by his favour with the Lord, he furniſhed them with all neceſſaires in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.

And it is known that the man was moſt eminently endowed, matchleſſe in his time. Thus what Kingly power <hi>Moſes</hi> had, was not only accidentall, but extraordinary. Therefore it can be no ground to Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts to build upon.</p>
               <p>Concluſ. 2. <hi>After the inſtitution of the ſeventy elders, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Jethro's <hi>counſell, neither</hi> Moſes, <hi>nor any other of the Judges had a Kingly power.</hi>

               <p>Firſtly, The people deſired <hi>Gideon</hi> to reign over them, and offered to devolve the Kingdom over into the hands of his poſterity. And <hi>Gideon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do ſo, and embraced not their offer, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. And he addeth this as the reaſon of his deniall, <hi>The LORD ſhall rule over you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Neither I, nor any of my poſterity can take upon us to reign over you as your Kings. Ye are the LORD'S peculiar people. Of whom the LORD hath a moſt ſpecial care. Any that rule over you, muſt be deputed by God in an extraordinary way. They muſt take the word at his mouth, ruling over you by an immediat dependency from him. Now, tell me, whether or not was <hi>Gideon</hi> King at this time? If he was King, <hi>ergo</hi> he refuſed to embrace the power which he had. And that is ridiculous. If he was not King, I obtain the point. Again, either they offered to <hi>Gideon</hi> a Kingly power, or not. If a Kingly power, <hi>ergo</hi> either <hi>Gideon</hi> was not King, or elſe by way of gratification, they offered him the power which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And that had been in them greater impertinency then courteſie. Yea, they had dealt altogether ridiculouſly. And ſure I am, <hi>Gideon</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwered them ſo, as he did, if he had had ſuch power. He had poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denied to enjoy that which really he did enjoy. And that they did offer him a Kingly power is manifeſt.

He judged them, led forth their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and commanded in chief. And conſequently either he was not King, or elſe the people offered no other power to him, then what formerly he had. And I cannot imagine, that ever they would have been ſo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, to gratifie his labours with the offer of juſt nothing.

They were all Judges alike.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Abimelcch</hi> had different power from the Judges. What power he had, was kingly. This is evident, 1.

And I muſt needs ſay, that authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is competent, whether to the kingly perſon, or to the kingly power. therefore the holy ghoſt in theſe places expreſſeth his purpoſe by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. and this he doth not apply to one particular judge, as to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> but to the whole incorporation of Judges. Then hear. Either <hi>Abimelech</hi> had different power from the Judges, or not. If different, <hi>ergo</hi> the Judges were not Kings, and had not Kingly power. The greateſt power <hi>Abimelech</hi> had, was Kingly. And therein he was differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Judges. You cannot ſay, that his power was not different from theirs, as is ſhewed already. And conſequently, his power at the moſt being kingly, and notwithſtanding different from the authority of the Judges, it neceſſarily followeth, that the Judges had not kingly power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Judges had had kingly power, then there had been no change in the Government, after <hi>Saul</hi> was ordained King. Thus there had been change, <hi>nomine,</hi> but not <hi>re.</hi> And ſo the people in vain had ſought a King, and <hi>Samuel</hi> in vain had denied them a King. Thus they ſought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and he denied nothing, but what they had before. <hi>Bellarmine, de Rom. pont. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. though to no purpoſe, laboureth to elude this, diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Rex,</hi> &amp; <hi>Prorex.</hi> Indeed we cannot but much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him becauſe he ſaith, That God in the time of the Judges was the proper and peculiar King of the Jews. This is ſhewed already. And ſo implieth <hi>Gideon</hi>'s anſwer, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. And this cutteth the back of what <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaith: for ſo they being but Viceroys, and God the only King, then had they not properly kingly power. This is what I crave. Yet in the <hi>interim</hi> I demand, whether or not they could extend their power, as the Kings? And that they could not, is manifeſt. Becauſe they had no more power then any of the Seventy and higher Sanhedrin. The Seventy were choſen to bear equal burden with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Judge, in all the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114526:91"/>
and moſt publick matters. <hi>Num.</hi> 11. Now, either conjunctively, or disjunctively, they had equal power with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Judge. If but conjunctively, theſe two abſurdities will follow. Firſtly, that the Judge was not ſubject to the Sanhedrin: for the equal is not ſubject to the equal. And if not ſubject to the Sanhedrin, I ſee no reaſon why he was not alſo unpuniſhable and abſolute. And ſo the Judge had greater power then the King. Which I am ſure, none will admit. Secondly, before the inſtitution of the Sanhedrin, all the greater and hard matters were reſerved to <hi>Moſes Ex.</hi> 18. And in this <hi>Moſes</hi> power was greater then the power of thoſe Judges, which he appointed at the advice and counſel of <hi>Juthro.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> finding, that he alone was not able to manage all the weighticſt matters, therefore in greateſt earneſtneſſe he beſought the Lord, to adde ſome to him, who might help him therein, and exonerate him of his burden. Mark a little: Either <hi>Moſes</hi> as yet remained the only Judge of greateſt matters or elſe every one of the higher Sanhedrin had equal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer with him. The reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> power was according to the object of it. The greater matters, the greater power, <hi>Ex.</hi> 18. So propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature requireth. If you ſay, that not witſtanding the inſtitution of the Sanhedrin, and its intermedling with great and weighty buſineſſes, the greateſt of matters were reſerved for <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Judge's managing. I underſtand not that. That is againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> deſire. The thing which he prayeth for, is, That the Lord would ordain ſome to bear burden with him, in diſcharging the weightieſt matters. We find no ſuch diſtinction in his deſire, as that ſome might be appointed to overſee ſome weighty matters, and himſelf notwithſtanding to reſerve in his own hand the managing of the greateſt affairs. Friend, this had been but a little eaſing of <hi>Moſes</hi> burden, under which he did grievouſly groan. Yea, in this caſe there had been great by-reſpect and ſelf-intereſt in <hi>Moſes</hi> deſire. No leſſe forſooth, then he ſhould be eaſed of his burden, and notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a lording power over his brethren. There is no little carnality in this deſire, and as great abſurdity to bind it upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Yea, were this true, he had been in power above the Seventy: for ſo his power did reach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the othen theirs, and might do what they could not. Tell not me, that his deſire was to be caſed of his burden, and notwithſtanding to remain chief man in the Commonwealth. There is great carnality and ſelf-intereſt there alſo. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſire is poſitive, without diſtinction. And if he, or any of the Judges was <hi>major ſingulis,</hi> I ſee no reaſon why they were not as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially Kings as <hi>Saul, David,</hi> &amp;c. The Kings had no more power. None of them according to Law, was <hi>major univerſis.</hi> So is demonſtrated already. And ſo in the ordination of Kings there was no eſſential and ſubſtantial change in the Common-wealth. The people ſought a King from <hi>Samuel.</hi> Was it not a fooliſh deſire to ſeek what they had already? <hi>Samuel</hi> denied a King to them. Was it not fooliſhneſſe in him to deny them that which already they had, and debate ſo much againſt it? Verily, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114526:92"/>
between them, if this be true, but <hi>pugna de lana caprina.</hi> And verily, <hi>Beliarm me</hi> wrongeth the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> very much, in alleadging, they ſought a deſpotick, heril, and hereditary King. There is no ſuch thing in their deſire, as is ſhewed already. They ſought no more but a King. According to the Law he was regulated. And it is known, that they did not give the kingdom to <hi>Saul</hi>'s poſterity. Well, let it be ſo, the Judge had greater power then any one member of the Sanhedrin; yet doth it follow, that he only had ſuch power as the annual Magiſtrate, <hi>v. g.</hi> in the <hi>Athenian Commonwealth.</hi> He had greater power then any one of the Councel. And yet he had not a kingly power. Here from we draw this Argument:</p>
               <p>That Government is <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> beſt, and moſt for the advantage both of Church and Commonwealth, which the Lord not only did firſtly inſtitute amongst the people of the Jews but alſo was unwilling to change it, and ſet-up another Government in place thereof:</p>
               <p>But the Lord not only did firſtly inſtitute Democracy amongst the people of the Jews, but alſo was unwilling to change it, and ſet-up another Government in place thereof:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> Democracy, <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> is the beſt Government, and moſt for the advantage both of Church and Commonwealth,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition,</hi> I ſuppoſe, cannot be denied: for whatſoever is moſt for the good of Church and Commonwealth, is moſt alſo for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour of God. And ſhall not I imagine, that the Lord moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth that which is moſt for his honour? As there is nothing which is ſo precious in the eyes of God as his own honour ſo he endeavoureth moſt to erect, preſerve, and maintain that which moſt contributeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. None will ſay, that the Lord ſlighteth his own honour, and poſtpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it to any created intereſt. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is made good from what foregoeth, not only in this, but alſo in the preceding Subſection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> from the judgment of the graveſt and wiſeſt Philoſophs. So <hi>Solon</hi> of whom it is ſtoried, 1. That he not only refuſed himſelf to reign over the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as King, but alſo he much endeavoured that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> ſhould not attain thereto. This he did for preſerving the liberties of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and popular government amongſt them inviolable. 2. He wrote ſeverall verſes againſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> becauſe they had ſet <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> over them, ſharply rebuking them that they had gone from the better to the worſe. 3. Becauſe the <hi>Atheniums</hi> had ſet up Monarchy amongſt them, therefore he leſt <hi>Athens</hi> and went into <hi>Egypt.</hi> 4. Not deſiring to live under Kingly government, he left <hi>Egypt, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> and came into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where he built a City, and called the name of it <hi>Solos.</hi> And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, that <hi>Craeſus</hi> having deſired him to come and live beſide him, he thanked him for his benevolent courteſie: But with all he added, that if he deſired not to live in a free Common-wealth (which he had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up in <hi>Cilicia</hi>) he would chooſe rather to live with him, then in <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:114526:92"/>
5. Being deſired by <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> to return to <hi>Athens,</hi> he told him, he would not, leſt he ſhould appear an approver of his deed, in taking upon him to reign as King. 6. He wrote an Epiſtle to <hi>Epimenides,</hi> wherein he excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly regrateth the fooliſhneſſe of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in tranſlating Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy into Monarchy. 7. He wrote to <hi>Periander</hi> King of <hi>Corinth,</hi> deſiring him to lay-down his Kingly power. 8. It is reported, that he did inſtitute popular government amongſt the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But the ſimple truth is, it was long before inſtituted by <hi>Theſeus.</hi> And by proceſſe of time, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth and the Laws thereof being corrupted, <hi>Solon</hi> reformed both. And as <hi>Solon,</hi> ſo likewaies all the reſt of the Sages, did prefer Democracy to any other government. <hi>Thales</hi> wrote to <hi>Solon</hi> in exile, deſiring him to come and dwell beſide, him at <hi>Miletum.</hi> And if he did abominate the <hi>Mileſian Monarchy,</hi> there was no-where he could be free of the trouble of Kings. And therefore he thought it beſt he ſhould live with him, and his own friends. Putting him in mind, how that <hi>Bias,</hi> one of the Wiſemen, had deſired him to come to <hi>Priene.</hi> And if he did ſo, he told him, they (meaning himſelf &amp; the reſt of the Sages) would flock about him. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their ſympathizing in affection with <hi>Solon,</hi> doth alſo inſinuat their ſympathizing with him in the matter of judgement. 'Tis ſtoried, that the Wiſeman <hi>Chilo</hi> was the firſt who inſtituted the <hi>Lacedemonian ephori,</hi> the repreſentative of the people. This is controverted. <hi>Soſicrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chilo</hi> did firſtly inſtitute the Ephorick Magiſtracy. To this enclineth <hi>Laertius de vit. Phil. lib.</hi> 1, <hi>in Chil. Herodot, Xenophon,</hi> and <hi>Satyrus</hi> ſay, it was inſtituted by <hi>Lycurgus; Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Val. Maximus,</hi> by <hi>Theopompus.</hi> Howſoever, I may determine on either of theſe two. 1. That <hi>Chilo</hi> was one of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy himſelf. Which made his brother envie him. 2. That not onely <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Theopompus,</hi> but alſo <hi>Chilo</hi> acted much for the maintenance and preſervation of that Magiſtracy. And in an epiſtle to <hi>Periander,</hi> he ſpareth not to ſay, that nothing is ſecure to a King, nor is he happy though he ſhould die in his bed without blood. <hi>Pittacus,</hi> one of the Sages, after he had reigned about ten years over the <hi>Mityleneans,</hi> willingly reſigned the Kingdom. Tell me, if that man deſired not people's liberty, who, though able to do ſo, would not ſo much as keep them under an eaſie yoke: for he did govern them according to moſt wholeſome laws and conſtitutions. And in his anſwer to <hi>Craeſus,</hi> he avoucheth that Law is the greateſt commander. Compare this ſpeech with his practice, and you will find he was a great friend to Democracy and people's liberty. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> greatly ſympathized with <hi>Solon</hi> in his exile. And in his Epiſtle to him, he deſireth him to come and dwell beſide him in <hi>Lind;</hi> which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a free City, not ſubjected to Kings and Princes. And there (ſaith he) you ſhall be free of all fear at <hi>Piſistratus</hi> hands. <hi>Periander,</hi> one of the Wiſe-men alſo, though at the firſt both a King and Tyrant, yet at laſt he appointed a Councell to govern at <hi>Corinth.</hi> Which I muſt needs think, was popular, becauſe in even-down terms he ſaith, that popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114526:93"/>
is better then Royall. And how much he was taken with high and noble thoughts of the Sages and Wiſe-men, doth more then appear from his Epiſtle directed to them. <hi>Epimenides</hi> in his epiſtle to <hi>Solon</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Athentans</hi> before <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> reigne, being free, and governed by moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table laws, would not ſtill lye under ſlavery and bondage. Obſerve, he calleth Kingly government, ſervitude and bondage. And in the <hi>interim</hi> he intreateth him to come and dwell beſide him in <hi>Crete,</hi> where there was no King to trouble him. <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth him much for departing from <hi>Samos</hi> into <hi>Croton,</hi> for avoiding the yoke of Monarchy. And withall he regrateth his own condition, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely ſubjected to the <hi>Mileſian Kings,</hi> but alſo threatned by the <hi>Median King</hi> with bondage, albeit the <hi>Ionians</hi> did contend for the liberty of all. This made him dolefully cry out, <hi>Oh, how can I,</hi> Anaximenes <hi>ſearch out Heaven's ſecrets. being expoſed to the hazard of death and bondage?</hi> And it cannot be denied but <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was all the way for Democracy. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Anaximenes</hi> writing to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> ſpeaketh of liberty: But ſure I am, Ariſtocracy doth as much, if not more, take-away liberty as Monarchy. What? it is the government of many Kings. And the tyranny of many is worſe then the tyranny of one. 2. Becauſe he went into <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia.</hi> And being fully inſtructed in their Laws, he returned from thence into <hi>Croton,</hi> where he ſet-up a Councell conſiſting of a thouſand members. This could not but be popular, if he followed the plat-form of the <hi>Cretian</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonian Commonwealths.</hi> His government is called Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, not as it is different from Democracy, but becauſe it was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the beſt. It is evident from <hi>Anaximenes</hi> epiſtle to him, that in the matter of government they were both of one judgment. <hi>Secrates</hi> is onely for popular government. He runneth ſo far on this way, that he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth upon theſe things. 1. All within the Kingdom have capacity of governing. 2. All things are common. 3. All the people are either ground-tillers or ſouldiers. I ſhall not ſtand here to repeat <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and cenſure on theſe things. But ſhortly you ſhall have our judgment of them. The firſt cannot be denied, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> for we ſuppoſe, all who are fit to govern, as occaſion ſerveth, ſhould be admitted thereto. And paſſing all carnall and naturall priviledges, there is none of the people, who <hi>per ſe</hi> and from nature, hath any more power to govern then another. Only qualification for conveniency of, and vocation to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, do make the difference amongſt men. The ſecond I cannot away with.

From theſe three things <hi>Socrates</hi> concludeth, That the Governours of the Commonwealth are that ſame way in reſpect of the people and theſe whom they govern, even as other threeds are in reſpect of ſilk.

And it is known, that by Ariſtocracy he doth not underſtand that, which is contradiſtinguiſhed from Democracy. No verily. But he oppoſeth it, not only to the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed multitude, but alſo to the Government of theſe, who are ſet-apart to govern, becauſe of ſome natural priviledges. Thus by Ariſtocracy he underſtandeth the Government of the beſt. And it is the very quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence and compleat form of Popular Government. 'Tis the ſquare and mid-way of removing the tyranny of Monarchy, and Oligarchy, and the confuſion of the popular multitude. This kind of Government he deſired <hi>Dion,</hi> to promote and ſet-up amongſt the <hi>Syracuſians.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, while as <hi>Dion</hi> was ſetting forward againſt <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> for reſtoring the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſians</hi> to liberty, and the up-ſetting of Popular Government amongſt them, he was incited thereto, and encouraged, not only by <hi>Eudamus,</hi> and the Governours of the Republick, but alſo by Philoſophers.

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of the chiefeſt Hiſtorians and Orators. <hi>Beroſus</hi> imputeth it as a great fault to <hi>Nimrod,</hi> becauſe he erected Kingly Government contrary to what <hi>Janus (i.e. Noah)</hi> gave commandment and precept for. <hi>Ant. lib.</hi> 4 I confeſs, what Government was before that time, was not purely politick. Yet it drew very near the borders of Democracy: for then they knew not what it was to be governed by one, or by ſome few, becauſe of riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſuch like. No verily they admitted no precedency, but purely natural and moral. Purely natural, becauſe (ſpeaking rigorouſly) they lived then as under fatherly and oeconomical Government. Purely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, becauſe thoſe did govern who were eminent in godlineſſe and vertue. It is called the golden age, becauſe then men were free of deceit, each one living in a brotherly &amp; conſcionable way with another. They knew not what Law-quircks and Politick quiddities meant then. All lived as under one common father, governed according to the Laws of pure Nature and Juſtice. <hi>Subſect.</hi> 2. <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. Thus then none were holden-back to govern, to whom Nature and Vertue had given the precedency. And this I find only to be the difference between Popular Government, and what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was then. The one was natural, and the other is political. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then did govern, not only becauſe of vertue and godlineſſe, but alſo
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114526:94"/>
becauſe of natural priority. No wonder, becauſe then they lived under Governours, as under natural fathers. Government then was rather oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical, then political. But Popular Government, though it giveth place to Phyſical and natural precedency, yet not in the matter of Government. It admitteth natural precedency in natural things. But in policy only ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and godlineſſe have the firſt place. Yet there is no repugnancy, but <hi>per accidens</hi> in politick things both may conſubſiſt. Natural precedency in it ſelf is not repugnantly capable of that which giveth political prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Herodot</hi> ſeemeth to commend <hi>Ottanes,</hi> who againſt <hi>Darius</hi> pleaded for the up-ſetting of Popular Government among the <hi>Perſims.</hi> He ſaith, that <hi>Ottanes</hi> took the middle way. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. But <hi>in medio stat virtus.</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der though he enclineth to <hi>Ottanes</hi> judgment, rather then to the opinion of <hi>Darius,</hi> who pleaded for Monarchy.

                  <hi>Athenians. Theompompus, Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> moſt noble Kings, and moſt notable patrons of Popular Government. And ſhall we not think, but <hi>Miltiades, Themiſtocles, Ariſtides, Cimon, Hannibal,</hi> and many other notable warriours, who did live under the yoke of Popular Government, eſteemed it the choiceſt of Governments? They acted much, both gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly and cheerfully, for the preſervation thereof. Men's practice is a more evident teſtimony of their judgement, then their profeſſion. 'Tis known, that <hi>Lyſander,</hi> an eminent warriour, in an oration to the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> perſwaded them to ſhake-off Kingly Government altogether. <hi>Plut. &amp; Prob. in Lyſ.</hi> Had that been, I ſuppoſe, the Ephorick Magiſtracy ſhould have governed all. Though <hi>Dion,</hi> a matchleſſe warriour, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the popular multitude, which inevitably begetteth confuſion; yet was he for <hi>Plato</hi>'s Ariſtocracy, which is reformed Democracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> From the example of the chiefeſt and moſt reformed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, whereof ſome were purely popular, and ſome mixed, <hi>v. g. dthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Cyrenian, Cumaean, Pyrean, Horean, Syracuſian, Tarentinian, Theban, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. &amp;c. Diodore,</hi> out of <hi>Herodot,</hi> reporteth, That the <hi>Aſſyrian Kingdom</hi> being overturned by the <hi>Medes,</hi> for a long time after the Cities were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned without Kings, by Popular Government.</p>
               <p>The point being thus eſtabliſhed, both by divine and human authority, it nextly falleth into our way to make it good from Reaſon it-ſelf. And for this we ſhall ſhortly give you the abridgement of the Arguments of ſome ancient Philoſophers, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alleadgeth, <hi>Polit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. and 12. As they do plead for Popular Government, ſo they do directly militat againſt Monarchy. The firſt is taken from the parity and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Members of the Republick, the ſecond from the neceſſity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, the third from the equity and infallibility of Law, the fourth from the inconveniency of ſetting man above Law, the fifth and ſixth from example. Sparing to repeat their arguments at length, we content our ſelf with an argument of our own framing. And it is this,</p>
               <p>That Government is <hi>ſimply</hi> beſt, which reſtoreth us neareſt, beyond all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to our condition and liberties in the ſtate of perfection and pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals:</p>
               <p>But Democracy reſtoreth us neareſt, beyond all Governments, to our condition and liberties in the ſtate of perfection and pure naturals:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> Democracy, <hi>ſimply,</hi> is the beſt Government.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is undeniable, becauſe the ſtate of perfection and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity is <hi>ſimply</hi> the beſt. It is without either ſpot or wrinkle. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the nearer we draw to that condition, our caſe is ſo much more excellent and good. And ſo, whatſoever Government reſtoreth us neareſt thereto, without all controverſie is <hi>ſimply</hi> beſt. In making good the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> we lay-down theſe two Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. No man by nature in a formal and antecedent way is born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:114526:95"/>Firſtly: If Nature tied man <hi>formally</hi> and in an antecedent way to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick ſubjection, we demand, Whether or not in ſuch reſpect it layeth bonds of ſubjection upon all men? If it doth, then Kings no leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e then ſubjects, are tied by Nature to juriſdiction. 1. Becauſe that which agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a thing <hi>formally</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is alſo competent to it <hi>univerſally</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. If Kings were not alſo ſubjected to Authority by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it would inevitably follow, all men, and not all men, were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to it. Which is implicatory. If not; then it followeth, That ſome men, by nature formally are born ſubject to Authority, and ſome not: Both which are repugnant: for if Nature, as Nature ſubjecteth man to Authority, it giveth exemption to none, more then to another. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhall either admit a ſimple contradiction, or elſe you ſhall deny all men to be natural. Therefore of neccſſity the Royalliſt muſt either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, all men according to Nature, to be born free, or elſe, both King, and People, by Nature to be born ſubject to Government. He muſt either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the one, or deny the other alſo. Which he proudly affirmeth. See what Philoſophy this is: Man by nature is <hi>formally</hi> born ſubject to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. So will the Royalliſts have it. This will be the Concluſion: <hi>Ergo</hi> man by nature is not <hi>formally</hi> born ſubject to Government. A plain contradiction indeed. The reaſon is: If nature ſubject man, <hi>formally,</hi> to Government, then it ſubjecteth all men thereto. And if all men, I demand, Whether or not doth nature ſubject one to another? If it doth, <hi>ergo</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>committitur circulus,</hi> or elſe one by nature is not ſubjected to another. Otherwiſe all according to nature are not ſubjected thereto, as is ſhewed to be. If not, <hi>ergo</hi> none by Nature are borne ſubjects: for ſo by Nature there is none, to whom they are ſubjected. <hi>Non. entus nulla ſunt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia.</hi> Therefore it inevitably followeth, either all to be born free, or elſe all to be born ſubjected to Government, and not to be born ſubjected thereto.</p>
               <p>Secondly: If Nature laid formal bonds of ſubjection upon Man to Politick Authority, we judge it very ſtrange, how there have been, and may be many families and ſocieties of men void and free of ſuch ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We can ſcarcely think, that the interveening of any accidental cauſe could obſtruct the current of ſuch a formal ſtream of Nature from iſſuing and ſtreaming forth its formal effect. We can hardly digeſt it, how Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture formally bending its ſtrength to produce Politick ſubjection, doth not alſo erect Government amongſt Beaſts, and ſubject one of them to another. See we not by experience, how natural predominants do alwaies produce effects ſuitable to their temper? Why may we not then with as good reaſon alleadge, that Nature producing Government and ſubjection to Policy, would have alſo through its natural ſourſe drawn all natural creatures to the erecting of Government and Policy amongſt them? How cometh it to paſſe, I pray you, there is not King-Lion, King-Eagle, King-Elephant? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:114526:95"/>Thirdly: If Nature <hi>formally</hi> tied ſome men to ſubjection, and <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> derived power of governing and reigning to others; then the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Judges and Governours, would be a formal and natural act, <hi>Phyſically</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> flowing from Nature's principles, not contingent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but neceſſarily. Which taketh away the freedom of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 75. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. in ſetting-up Governours and Rulers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleaſure, excluding all formal and phyſical neceſſity from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And not only ſo, but alſo it ſolloweth, that both Rulers, and ruled, are eternal and unchangeable. Which is repugnant both to Experience and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> and <hi>Indian Philoſophs</hi> did enact it by Law, That all by Nature were free-born, and none were ſervants, but to be of equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and alike dignity. <hi>Diod. Ant. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſaith, In all men the deſire of liberty is innate, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> averreth, All men ſtudy to liberty, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. <hi>de bel. Gal.</hi> And <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> affirmeth, All men by Nature to be free, whom Nations have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to bondage. 12. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 2. The Law ſpeaketh much for us in this, and in poſitive terms ſaith, what we affirm, <hi>L. manumiſſ. F. de juſt. &amp; jur. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>digeſt. tit.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſt. tit.</hi> 5. <hi>Ulpian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Juſtian,</hi> diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law of Nature, and the Law of Nations. The one is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, only relating to man; the other is general, relative both to man and beaſt. <hi>Ulp. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect. ult. Juſt. dig. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. But I pray you, Wherein can the Law of Nature be common, both to man and beaſt, if you affirm Nature to have laid ſtrait bonds of ſubjection upon one to another? We find by experience, that Lions are not ſubject to King-Lion, Boars to King-Boar, Eagles to King-Eagle. And ſo you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul this community of the Law of Nature to Man and Beaſt, if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſubjective authority formally to flow from Nature. They do as yet more clearly difference theſe Laws, calling the one ſlavery, and the other liberty. <hi>Ulp. lib. man. D. Juſt. dig. lib.</hi> 1. Hence <hi>Ulpian. Inſt. lib.</hi> 1. and <hi>Juſtinian, Dig. lib.</hi> 1. ſay, That all by Nature being free-born, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſſion to Nature is unknown. It is the conſequent of ſervitude accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nations. See alſo <hi>Juſt. Inſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 5. Whence is it, out of <hi>Florentine,</hi> he defineth liberty from Nature, and ſervitude from the cuſtom of Nations. <hi>Dig. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 5. Where liberty is expreſly oppoſed to Government and Authority. The one is called humane conſtitution, and the other, Nature's birth.</p>
               <p>But the Lawyer <hi>Prate</hi> would make us beleeve, by the Law of Nations <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> do underſtand, a humane, univerſal Law and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by ſervitude, praedure and tyrannous form of Government. And ſo (faith he) the Law of Nations muſt not alwaies be oppoſed to the Law of Nature, as <hi>Livius</hi> ſaith. Neither muſt we think (faith he) that all Civil Conſtitution is contrary to Nature, but ſuch as draweth the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into ſlavery. The Lawyer <hi>Baldwin</hi> ſeemeth to take him by the hand,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114526:96"/>
whileas he calleth the Law of Nations, the particular Law of Nature. But the man, <hi>com. in. Juſtit. Inſt. lib.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. ſeemeth neither to be much for it, nor much againſt it. Nay but Mr. <hi>Prate</hi> wreſteth <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> their meaning: for if the Law of Nature were taken by them for any humane Law, then ſhould humane Law be common both to man and beaſt. Do not they ſay, the Law of Nature is common to both? Therefore you ſhall either conclude, beaſts to be men, and affected with humane faculties, or elſe you ſhall reſtrict your univerſal within the bounds of a particular.</p>
               <p>But if you ſhall ſay, That by the Law of Nations they underſtand an Univerſal Statute, and general Sanction, as it is contradiſtinct from the Civil Law, you alſo gain juſt nothing for your pains. 1. Becauſe in ſuch a notion, the Law of Nations is not the proper and immediat oppoſit of the Law of Nature. So it is properly and immediatly oppoſed to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> out of <hi>Caius</hi> abundantly cleareth: for as he oppoſeth <hi>Digeſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>loc.</hi> 1. the Law of Nature to the Law of Nations, <hi>ſo loc. 9.</hi> and <hi>Inst. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. <hi>loc.</hi> 2. he contradiſtinguiſheth the Law of Nations from the Civil Law. In the one he taketh the Law of Nations, as being the immediate oppoſit of the Law of Nature, and in the other, as being the proper oppoſit of the Civil Law. 2. Becauſe both <hi>Ulpian,</hi> and <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> in the forequoted places, do call the Law of Nations, a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt men. But by your leave, if we take a narrow view of the Law of Nations, we ſhall find it rather particular, then general; it being taken as immediatly oppoſed to the Civil Law: for ſo it is taken in a ſtrict and rigorous acceptation. And ſuch Law hath greateſt footing, when Monarchy and the governing power is univerſal.</p>
               <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Prate</hi> alleadgeth, That by ſervitude, is underſtood ſlavery and tyranny, he is far in the wrong to <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> They mean no ſuch thing. 1. Becauſe <hi>Juſtinian</hi> calleth Liberty, a natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, enclining to that which any man pleaſeth to do, unleſſe it be obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted either by ſtrength, or Law. In which we mark two things that make much for us. Firſtly, Liberty is referred to the natural faculty of the Will. So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defineth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Polit.</hi> Now no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can be called the natural faculty of the Will, or any power of the Mind. Secondly. Liberty is oppoſed not only to force and violence, but alſo to Law and Ordinance. Theſe two things do abſolutely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the reaſon of Liberty from Government, in ſo far as it is taken for natural liberty. Now, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to the definition of Liberty ſubjoyneth the definition of Servitude. But, by your favour, why may not I with far better reaſon ſay, That <hi>Juſtinian</hi> taketh Servitude for Government, then you can alleadge him to take it for ſlavery and tyrannous authority? for as he defineth Liberty, it is uncompetent both to lawful, and unlawful authority. If Government be natural, the Liberty of which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſpeaketh, is no waies competent to it. He ſpeaketh not of natural, but of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114526:96"/>
morall liberty. 2. Becauſe <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> call Servitude, <hi>conſtitutie juris gentium.</hi> But my friend, what Ethnick, much leſſe Chriſtian, would have called tyranny, <hi>conſtitutio juris,</hi> and not rather <hi>conſtitutio non-juris?</hi> Shew me another place where they take <hi>jus gentium</hi> abuſively in a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſtick ſignification. 3. Albeit we ſhould yeeld this to <hi>Mr. Prate,</hi> yet ſhould he no whit encroach upon the main purpoſe in hand: for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly cleared, that they underſtand all men by nature to be born free. <hi>Jure enim naturali</hi> (ſaith <hi>Juſtinian</hi>) <hi>omnes homines ab initio liberinaſceban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

               <p>The reaſon of this is clearer then the light: for in the ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Nature lieth between two ſtraits. Either it muſt be altogether beſlaved to the predominant tyranny of it's corruption, or elſe patiently ſubmit it-ſelf to Government's yoke. Thereby it mindeth to redintegrat that which by Corruption it loſed. It knoweth that it would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the ſuper-dominion of lording luſts, if it did not come under the reverence of government. It chooſeth rather to take it's hazard of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to a friend, then become captive to a foe, and alwayes remain his priſoner. Thus it no otherwiſe mindeth government, but as in the caſe of fallen man it cannot be ſecure, nor preſerved from the rage of luſt without it.

               <p>This being done, you may abundantly learn herefrom, what man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is in the ſtate of perfection &amp; integrity. 'Tis a condition altogether unliable to any Politick ſubjection. It rendereth all free unſubjected to government. Yet we muſt not think, that it giveth man immunity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the Morall Law. That were a giving him power above his duty. Thus he ſhould be rendered an out-law. But in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, man was moſt ſtrictly engaged to all the duties of the Morall Law. He was obliged to perform them under pain of higheſt cenſure. He was anſwerable then to no humane Judicatory but only to the Judge of judges. His caſe was ſuch, that he needed no governours to hedge-in his ways. He needed nothing for that but his own nature. It's integrity and perfection was the beſt governor and government. But ſince the fall, Man
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114526:97"/>
is become exceeding labill, and ſtandeth in need of many things which he did not before. Since the fall he is obliged no leſſe then before it, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve GOD's Law. And though before the fall he was free and ſubject to none but to GOD, yet now he cometh under Tutory. Before the fall he needed no Tutors, having wit enough then to govern himſelf. But ſince the fall, he is become infirm and ignorant, and ſtandeth now in need of Tutors to help his infirmities. And the beſt Tutor he can have is govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Now tell me, which of the governments is beſt? No queſtion, that which advanceth him neereſt his firſt and primary condition. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no otherwiſe intendeth government, but as it contributeth in ſome meaſure or other to make up what it hath loſed in the ſtate of corruption. And as it hath loſed integrity, ſo likewayes liberty. It had both theſe in the ſtate of perfection. Well, will any deny, but of all goverments, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy is moſt for liberty? Monarchy and Ariſtocracy draw peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's liberty within a narrow compaſſe. In the one, the whole liberty of the people is devolved upon one, and in the other upon ſome few. Thus the liberty which Man had in the ſtate of perfection, is extreamly eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed. It denieth his native liberty to him, though in a larger meaſure he be capable of it. But Democracy giveth people their full liberty which they had in the ſtate of perfection, in ſo much as they are capable of it. It with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth nothing of it from them, which in conveniency and without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law it can give unto them. It cannot conveniently give them the whole liberty which they had in their primary condition. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſhould be without government. And ſo they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come out-laws, looſe and diſſolute. Thus they ſhould come under the dominion of ſin. Which is not liberty, but ſlavery. To prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable and extreame contagion of which, Nature hath provided Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as a remedy. And that government which advanceth Nature in the ſtate of fallen man, in as much as it is capable of, to the liberty, which it had in the ſtate of innocency and before the fall, no queſtion muſt be the chiefeſt temedy againſt ſuch contagion. Thus Nature in the ſtate of Corruption is advanced ſo neer as is poſſible to it's ſtate it was in in the caſe of perfection. But Democracy a mongſt all Governments, is that which advanceth Nature neereſt to the liberty which it had in the ſtate of perfection. It giveth liberty not onely to one, and ſome few, but alſo to all. It with-holdeth liberty from none, in ſo far as it can conſubſiſt with obedience to the Law; to which Man was ſubjected in the very ſtate of innocency. It no otherwiſe with-holdeth liberty, but as it preventeth Corruption's ſlavery. <hi>Ergo,</hi> of all Governments it is ſimply beſt. No wonder: for it advanceth Man neereſt the condition he was in in the ſtate of perfection.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV. Whether or not is it lawful to reſiſt the Royal Perſon, and decline the Royal Authority?</head>
               <p>IT will be greater eaſe for us, to remove this difficulty, then thoſe which formerly, by the Lords abundant help, we have fully diſcuſſed. You learn our mind in this matter from that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Aſſert. 1. <hi>It is not lawful to reſiſt the King, as King, nor the Kingly Power, as the Kingly power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is very good reaſon for this: for the King, as King, is ordained by God, and Kingly Government in it ſelf is God's Ordinance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>formally, poſitively,</hi> and <hi>directly,</hi> we cannot reſiſt the King, nor the Kingly power; unleſſe we be found fighters againſt God. This is at length made good by us, <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>aſſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Aſſert. 2. <hi>It is lawful and commendable, to reſiſt the tyranny of the King, and the abuſe of his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we make good from ſeveral examples in Scripture. 1. From the example of <hi>Saul's</hi> Army, which in reſiſting him, reſcued <hi>Jonathan</hi> from his fury. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. Royalliſts, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Symons,</hi> and <hi>Ferne,</hi> do opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionate, this was done by no violence, but by prayers and tears. But this is ſalſe. There is not a word of prayers and tears in the text. The people without, and contrary to the King's conſent enter in oath for reſcuing <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan.</hi> Yea, which is more, contrary to the King's oath, they laid their heads together, and did bind themſelves by oath to reſcue him. The King's oath is, <hi>God do ſo, and more alſo: for thou ſhalt ſurely die, Jonathan.</hi> The People's oath is contrary to that,—<hi>As the Lord liveth, there ſhall not one hair of his head fall to the ground:</hi>—They go not behind his back, but they tell it him in his face.—<hi>the people ſaid unto</hi> Saul, <hi>Shall</hi> Jonathan <hi>die</hi>—? Thus they withſtand him to his face. The very higheſt degree of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. 2. <hi>David</hi> reſiſted and withſtood <hi>Saui</hi>'s ſury, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.23 &amp;c. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 12. Nay but <hi>Arniſaus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Davi</hi>'s fact in reſiſting <hi>Saul,</hi> and defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by arm, againſt him was extraordinary. He was anointed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by God, as ſucceſſour to <hi>Saul.</hi> But the man is far miſtaken: for if it be lawful in an extraordinary caſe to reſiſt Kings, no queſtion in it ſelf it is lawful to reſiſt them. And ſo, it being in it ſelf a thing lawful, it may be put in action, both in an extraordinary and ordinary caſe. See <hi>ſubſect.</hi> 2. <hi>prop.</hi> 1. And though <hi>David</hi> was deſigned King by the Lord, yet was he not formally called thereto by the People, in the time of <hi>Saul</hi>'s reign. Will any
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114526:98"/>
deny, but <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo long as he lived, was King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that <hi>David</hi> was his ſubject? Otherwiſe <hi>David</hi> was very far out of it, in calling him, <hi>The Lords Anointed, his Master, Lord, and King.</hi> We ſay no more, but refer you to <hi>Lex Rex, quoest.</hi> 32, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> finding-out another ſtarting-hole, faith, <hi>David with arms only defended himſelf against</hi> Saul's <hi>tyranny, but not to cut him off, as the</hi> Engliſh Rebels, <hi>and bloody butchers did, in cutting-off</hi> Charls 1. <hi>Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 4. This is all we ſay concerning <hi>David.</hi> And there was very good reaſon for it, why <hi>David</hi> did not cut him off, though he was ſeveral times at his mercy. Firſtly, becauſe he could not do it legally. Though he had power legally to reſiſt him, yet had he not power legally to cut him off. The very Law of Nature teacheth ſelf-defence, though by the ſinalleſt means. But the off-cutting of the Delinquent only belongeth to the Magiſtrate and Judge, unleſſe it be in an extraordinary cafe. Nature hath alwaies Law enough for ſelf-defence, but not ſo for puniſhing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents. The one is natural, the other political. Secondly, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>David,</hi> by extraordinary impulſion was carried-by the off-cutting of <hi>Saul.</hi> Whileas <hi>Abiſhai</hi> went about to kill him, <hi>David</hi> forbade him. And told him he ſhould be cut-off and periſh another way, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. Where you ſhall find <hi>David</hi> dehorting <hi>Abiſhai</hi> from laying hands on <hi>Saul,</hi> from theſe two grounds. Firſtly, from the non-legality of the fact. He is <hi>the Lords Anointed.</hi> Thus he holdeth <hi>Saul</hi> as his ſuperiour. And therefore he had not power to cut him off. 'Tis uſurpation in the inſeriour, to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſuperiour. Secondly, from the aſſurance of <hi>Saul</hi>'s periſhing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way.—<hi>As the Lord liveth, the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to die, or he ſhall deſcend into battel and periſh.</hi> Would <hi>David</hi> ſay, It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe either for me; or for thee, <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> to lay hands on <hi>Saul:</hi> Aſſure thy ſelf he ſhall be cut off another way. But I belceve this man cannot ſay, the Repreſentative of the <hi>Engliſh Commonwealth</hi> had ſuch reaſons for them, for keeping them back from cutting off <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Eliſhah</hi> commanded to ſhut the door upon <hi>Jehoram</hi>'s teeth. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, <hi>the ſon of a murderer.—See ye, how the ſon of a murderer hath ſent to take-away mine head. Look when the meſſenger cometh, ſhut the doer, and hold him fast at the door,</hi>—2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6. Thus he giveth orders to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, thoſe who did fit in the Sanhedrin, being with him in the houſe, violently to keep it out againſt <hi>Jehoram,</hi> and his meſſenger. The word in the original, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> proporteth a moſt violent way of reſiſting. it ſignifieth a holding faſt at the door with preſſing. so the seventy, <hi>Chaldee paraphrast, Avenarius,</hi> and others do render it. 'Tis a vain thing in Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts, to imagine, <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> and the Elders with him did not reſiſt the King, but his meſſenger. 1. The text maketh clear againſt this.—<hi>[1s] not the found of his maſters feet behind him?</hi> Thus <hi>Eliſhah</hi> commandeth the door to be ſhut upon the meſſenger, becauſe the King was backing him, and coming-in immediatly after the cut-throat. This intimateth to us, the ſhutting of the door, and the out-keeping of the houſe, was mainly againſt <hi>Jehoram</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114526:98"/>
His immediate approaching upon the back of the meſſenger, is the ground of ſhutting the door, and keeping-out the houſe. They alleadge alſo this to be an extraordinary act. <hi>Quaſi vero</hi> ſelf-defence were not a thing moſt natural and ordinary. Away with this eluſion. 2. Becauſe what the King's emiſſary doth in the King's name, is done by him, as in the King's perſon and authority. And ſo <hi>virtualiter</hi> at leaſt it is all one to reſiſt the King's emiſſary, and to reſiſt the King himſelf. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> would looſe the knot another way. <hi>And</hi> (faith he) <hi>the impure Puritans can conclude nothing from thus, for cutting-off the head of</hi> Charles 1. <hi>The Prophet did not take it on him, to cut-off</hi> Jehoram. <hi>That was done by</hi> Jehu, <hi>whom God extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily ſtirred-up thereto. Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 4. Who ever ſaw ſuch a man as this? He only raileth, and ſhifteth the Queſtion. The Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us now, is not concerning the off-cutting, but the ſimple act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Kings. And though <hi>Eliſhah</hi> did not cut-off <hi>Jehoram,</hi> yet he cannot deny, but he withſtood him, and defended himſelf againſt his violence. This is all for the preſent we crave. Neither can he deny, but <hi>Eliſhah</hi> gave orders to one of the children of the Prophets, to anoint <hi>Jehu</hi> King. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went forth, and did cut-off <hi>Jehoram,</hi> executing the purpoſe of God on the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> From which example is ſhewed already, to be lawful to cut-off delinquent Kings. It is the Magiſtrat's part, and not the Prophet's, unleſſe it be by extraordinary impulſion, to cut-off the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. And ſo, as from the example of <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> it is lawful to reſiſt, ſo from the example of <hi>Jehu</hi> (whom <hi>Eliſhah</hi> cauſed to be anointed, for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-off the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi>) it is lawful to cut-off delinquent Kings.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Libnah</hi> made defection from <hi>Jehoram</hi> and revolted from him, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 21. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> ſtudieth to elude this, yet he faith nothing againſt it, but what others of his own tribe ſaid before him. And (faith he) <hi>Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's revolt, in respect of God, the Judge of all the earth, was a just puniſhment of</hi> Jehoram<hi>'s ſins. But in respect of the revolters, it is no where juſtified in all the text. Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 4. But with his leave, the text inſinuateth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This you may learn from comparing the revolt of <hi>Libnah</hi> with the revolt of the <hi>Edomites. So the</hi> Edomites <hi>revolted from under the hand of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>unto this day.</hi>—There is nothing added to that. <hi>The ſame time alſo did</hi> Libnah <hi>revolt from under his hand.</hi>—This is added as a reaſon, <hi>becauſe be had for ſaken the Lord God of his fathers.</hi> Thus is abundantly holden-one unto us, that <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Libnah</hi> revolted from <hi>Jeboram</hi> in a different way. No queſtion, in reſpect of God, the cauſe and ground of the revolt of both, is one. God cauſed both to revolt, to puniſh the ſins and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Jehoram.</hi> But in reſpect of the Revolters there are different cauſes. The <hi>Edomites</hi> revolted, becauſe they diſdained to live under the yoke of the King of <hi>Judah.</hi> The text faith, they choſe a King of their own. And from that, which is added as a ground of <hi>Libnah</hi>'s revolt, it is more then apparent to us, it revolted from a principle of Religion. And theſe who comment upon the text ſay, <hi>Libnah</hi> revolted, becauſe <hi>Jehoram</hi> preſſed the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114526:99"/>
people of the Land to Idolatry. I ſuppoſe upon good reaſon <hi>Libnah</hi>'s revolt is far more juſtifiable, then the defection of the ten Tribes from <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam.</hi> The one revolted upon a natural, and the other upon a ſpiritual accompt. And yet, as is ſhewed already, the ten Tribes revolted allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Uzziah</hi> was withſtood by <hi>Azariah,</hi> accompanied with fourſcore valiant Prieſts of the Lord. And in this, contrary to the doctrine of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts, we ſhall make good theſe three things. 1. That they reſiſted him violently. 2. allowably, 3. that they dethroned him. The firſt is evident from the text. Firſtly, becauſe it is ſaid, they withſtood him.<hi>They withstood</hi> Uzziah <hi>the King,</hi>—2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they are words of violent reſiſtance, ſignifying to <hi>ſtand againſt.</hi> And for this cauſe the fourſcore Prieſts are called men of valour <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſons of ſtrength.</hi> So the Seventy, and <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> tranſlate them. It maketh us imagine, they were purpoſely ſelected from amongſt the reſt of the Prieſts, becauſe of their valour and ſtrength, to withſtand <hi>Uzziah</hi> in facrificing. Secondly, becauſe they did thruſt <hi>Uzziah</hi> violently out of the Temple—<hi>Azariah, the chief Prieſt, and all the Priests,—thruſt him out from thence, Ibil.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſigniſieth <hi>to thruſt out with violence.</hi> They hurried him out of the Temple, as the word importech. The ſecond is alſo manifeſt, becauſe the Lord at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the undertaking of the Prieſts with miraculous and extraordinary ſuccesfulneſſe. They no ſooner laid hands on the King, but beyond all expectation, the Lord did put hand in him alſo. He did back them nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. They no ſooner did reſiſt the King, but aſſoon the Lord from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did ſtrike him with Leproſie. And is it imaginable but the Lord one way or other had plagued them alſo, if they had failed in their-duty to the King? I can ſee no reaſon, why he ſhould have ſpared them in failing in their duty, more then he did not ſpare <hi>Uzziah</hi> in failing in his duty. And, which is more the Prieſts do not groundleſly withſtand him. They argue from the King's duty, and from their duty. They tell him in plain terms, It did not become the King to ſacriſice, <hi>Num.</hi> 18. but the Prieſts, <hi>Ex.</hi> 30. Upon theſe grounds they ſet-to, to withſtand him, and keep him back from burning incenſe. Which inſinuat, that their act of reſiſting him was in no part of his duty, and that which was proper to his kingly charge, but only in maintaining their own liberties, and what according to God's Law, was due to them. Would they ſay, We will withſtand thee, O King, and have reaſon to do ſo; becauſe, as thou doſt that which is not incumbent to thee, ſo thou encroacheſt upon the peculiar liberties of our charge. The third is beyond controverſie, though Royalliſts ſtart much at it. (1.) Becauſe he was cut-off from the houſe of the Lord. This was becauſe of his Leproſy: for according to the Law, the Leper was cut-off from the Congregation. Thus the Prieſts ſpare not to execute the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, though Royalliſts eſtecm him, to have exemption and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity therefrom. <hi>And</hi> Uzziah, <hi>the King, was a leper unto the day of his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114526:99"/>
death, and dwelt in a ſoveral houſe, being a leper: for be was cut-off from the houſe of the Lord,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſigniſie, <hi>a ſolitary houſe, far from reſort and ſociety.</hi> Thus <hi>Uzziah</hi> was ſeparated, ſo long as he lived, from the ſociety of men. Which is the Law concerning the Leper, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. (2.) Becauſe his ſon was enkinged ſo ſoon as <hi>Uzziah</hi> was ſeparated from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.—<hi>And</hi> Jotham <hi>his ſon [was] over the King's houſe, judging the people of the Land. Ibid.</hi> and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. Tell me, is it likely, or can it ſtand with reaſon, they would have enkinged the ſon, the father as yet remaining King? And I pray you, had it not been great madneſſe in them, to retain the kingly power in <hi>Uzziah</hi>'s hand, after he was cut-off from the houſe of the Lord, becauſe of his leproſie? Firſtly, becauſe he was as an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate man. And thoſe who had not intereſt in the Church, had not intereſt in the State; the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> being national. What <hi>David</hi> doth in reforming the State, is in relation and ſubordination to the good of the Church. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 101. Secondly, the man being thus cut-off, was as unfit to govern, as either ſtock or ſtone. I beleeve, God appointed not idiots and unſit men to reign. We ſhall ſpeak nothing here of theſe examples, whereby is holden-out, not only the lawſulneſſe of reſiſting, but alſo of off-cutting of Kings, this not being the proper place thereof. We do only here ſpeak of the ſimple act of Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>We adde to theſe examples a few reaſons. <hi>Firſtly:</hi> Theſe who have power to reſiſt the tyranny of the King, and will not, offering both their bodies &amp; goods to his ſury, may very juſtly be called negative murderers and robbers of themſelves. Thus they expoſe them needleſly to the Kings mercileſſe cruelty. Not unlike the man, who being able to preſerve both his life, and his goods from the robbers committeth all unto their merei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hands. Who will not ſay, and that juſtly, but ſuch an one is a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murderer, and ſelf-robber?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly:</hi> It is againſt very Nature it-ſelf, men having power in their hands, to defend themſelves againſt the unjuſt violence and rage of the King, and yet to be wanting therein. Either Nature hath conferred upon them ſuch power in vain, or not. You cannot ſay in vain; unleſſe you reflect upon the Authour of Nature, who worketh every thing to good purpoſe. And Nature, as it is in it-ſelf, is good and perfect. So it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant for it, confidered as it is in it-ſelf, to work unſquarely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducc bad effects.

Some are ſo impudent, that they bluſh not to ſay, by <hi>higher powers</hi> are only underſtood Kings. But the contrary of this is true. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the kingly power is not the higher power, as if there were no power above it. It is not abſolute, but limited, as is already demonſtrated. 2. The King is not above all the people. One of the beſt Kings we read of, is but worth ſome thouſands of the people. <hi>David,</hi> a matchleſſe King, at the moſt is called worth ten thouſand, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. So then, though the kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> may be called the higher power, yet <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> it is not. The power of the people ſimply and abſolutely is the higher power. The authour of the Exercitation <hi>Conc. uſurp. pow.</hi> by <hi>higher power</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no other then lawful and unuſurped Magiſtracy. And this man bringeth ſome Arguments, but to no purpoſe to prove this, <hi>ch.</hi> 5 Which we take-up ſhortly into theſe two particulars. 1. Uſurped powers are not powers ordained of God. The powers the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, have their ordination from God. 2. The powers the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of may not be reſiſted under the pain of damnation, and are appointed for the good of people. Uſurped powers are not ſo. This man miſtaketh the matter very far. He will do well, carefully to diſtinguiſh between the uſurped power as it is uſurped, and as it is a power. In the firſt notion it is not of God, but of the Devil. But ſure I am, in the ſecond notion, it is of God. As it is a power, it is a real beeing. But who will deny, that every thing <hi>effectively</hi> dependeth from God, and is ordained by him? A thing as it is in it ſelf, is good. And ſo it cannot but be ordained by God, &amp; approved of him. Thus it carrieth along with it God's Image and ſpecies. And ſure I am. God never hated his own Image in any of his creatures. This is more deep, then half-wit can draw. It is handled by us at length, <hi>curſ. Philoſophico-theol. disp.</hi> 8. <hi>ſect.</hi> 29. I wonder if this Gentle-man will deny, but <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi>'s power which he had over the Nations was uſurped. The beſt title he had to them, was his ſword. And yet the Lord owneth him in his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, commiſſionateth him to undertake, and ſetteth-up his throne, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. What? had he any right over the Jews, but the lawleſſe right of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? Yet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> many times exhorted them to ſubject their necks to him, upon loſſe to themſelves, and diſobedience to God. And <hi>Ezekiel, ch.</hi> 17. threatneth them with deſtruction, becauſe of their denying obedience to him. And I pray you, what better right had <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the Kingdoms of the Nations, then <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar?</hi> And yet the Lord calleth him, his

Thus it is moſt evident, that not only uſurped powers, as powers, are ordained of God, but alſo all lawful obedience is due to them. Sure I am, whileas the Apoſtle wrote this to the <hi>

I go forward. And for the other particular. I would have this Gentleman obſerving with me. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the duty of the inſeriour towards the ſuperiour. This he preſſeth by ſeveral arguments. 2. He preſcribeth the duty of the Magiſtrate and ſuperiour towards the inferiour. I confeſſe, more expreſly and largely he ſpeaketh of the firſt, then of the ſecond for as he preſſeth the duty of the inſeriour toward the ſuperiour, tacitly and by the way he interlaceth the duty of the ſuperiour toward the inferiour. Now, albeit the A poſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth obedience upon the inferiour, both toward good and bad, tyrannous and non-tyrannous powers and Rulers, yet hath he very great reaſon for him, to exhort all Rulers and powers, to exerciſe and adminiſter juſtice. Albeit it be the duty of the inſeriour, to give obedience to the uſurped and tyrannous power, yet it becometh the Magiſtrate not to uſurp nor tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize. And ſo the one being incumbent to the inſeriour, and the other to the ſuperiour, the A poſtle preſſeth upon both of them their duty. No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, both of them may, and doe fail in their duty; yet it doth become the A poſtle to preſſe their duty upon both. And in this that the A poſtle faith, the Magiſtrate is God's miniſter, appointed by him for the good of the people, in exerciſing judgment and rightcouſneſſe: it doth not follow that he only ſpeaketh of lawful and un-uſurped powers. No verily. But he tacitly herein diſclaimeth ſuch powers, and preſcribeth what ſhould be the nature and power of Magiſtrats <hi>de jure,</hi> and not what it is <hi>de facto.</hi> And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114526:101"/>
as it is the ſuperiour's <hi>jus,</hi> to rule in righteouſneſſe, ſo it is the <hi>jus</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to give all lawful and due obedience, whether to the uſurped, or non-uſurped power. So is proved already. The reaſon that maketh this man ſo far miſconſtrue the A poſtle's meaning, is, to cut-off allegeance from the uſurped power, and, as he ſaith, from the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> which he is not aſhamed to call an uſurped power. But he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the aire. To make ſhort work of this, we demand, Whether or not the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> did lawfully give-up allegeance to the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi> If they did lawfully, <hi>ergo</hi> it is lawful to give-up allegeance to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped power. Sure I am, <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi>'s power over the <hi>Jews</hi> was meet uſurpation. And therefore the Lord threatneth to puniſh the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and deſtroy his Kingdom, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 10. If unlawfully, <hi>ergo</hi> it was lawful for them, to break the oath of allegeance given to him. But this they could not: for the Prophets threatned them with wrath for the violation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But becauſe this matter is not only moſt clear in it ſelf, but alſo we have little or nothing to do with it, therefore we content our ſelf with this ſlender view we have taken of it. We leave this, and come to <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> who is of an higher ſtrain then he. Indeed he pleadeth for ſubjection and allegeance to the worſt of powers. But to take away all that he objecteth, obſerve theſe few things concerning the clear meaning and expoſition of the place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>1. Carefully diſtinguiſh between the ſuperiour, and inferiour. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the power it-ſelf, and the abuſe thereof. For the firſt we ſay. It is unlawful and not permitted, whether by the Law of God. or the Law of Nature, to the inferiour to reſiſt the ſuperiour. And as it is not lawful for the inferiour to reſiſt the ſuperiour, neither is it lawful to reſiſt the ſuperior power, as it is in it ſelf. We find both theſe in the text. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers.</hi>—The higher or ſuperiour, preſuppoſeth lower and inferiour. The one is correlat of the other. Thus it is evident, the ſubjection and non-reſiſtance ſpoken-of by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. is between the inferiour and ſuperiour. And withal remark, the Apoſtle preſleth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the power, and non-reſiſtance thereof. He doth not command obedience to the abuſe and tyranny of it. We do therefore ſay, the place maketh nothing againſt us, but much for us. Though it be not lawful for inferiours to reſiſt ſuperiours. (That cannot be done, unleſſe the inferiour intrude himſelf upon the right of the ſuperiour, and uſurp that, which he hath not). Yet is it very commendable, for the ſuperiour, to reſiſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour. Therefore it is undoubtedly lawful for the people, or their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, to reſiſt the King. And that becauſe their power is above his. His power is not abſoſute admitting no bounds. And conſequently, the text ſpeaketh againſt the reſiſtance made by the King againſt the people. The people's power is the higher, yea the ſupream power. And ſo ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience is ſo much more to be performed thereto. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commandeth ſubjection, and non-reſiſtance to any higher power,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114526:101"/>
though but higher <hi>ſecundum quid.</hi> His words are indefinit and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. <hi>Ergo</hi> much more to the higheſt, and the higher power <hi>ſimpliciter.</hi> And thus the A poſtle to good purpoſe, exhorteth Chriſtians up and down the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and namely in, and about the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſubject their necks to the yoke of the <hi>Roman Magiſtrates.</hi> They were indeed infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them both in power and dignity. They could not have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them, being but an handful unleſſe they had become ſelf-murderers and uſurpers of power, which both God and Nature had denied them. And though it be unlawful to reſiſt the power, as it is in it ſelf, yet it is lawful, as is ſaid already, to withſtand the abuſe and tyranny thereof. It doth not follow, that <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth ſubjection and non-reſiſtance to the tyranny of the power, becauſe he commandeth ſubjection and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance to the power it ſelf. This is a fallacy <hi>ab accidente.</hi> The abuſe of the power is altogether extrinſecal to the power it-ſelf. And <hi>ab extrinſeco ad intrinſecum</hi> the conſequence is vain. Thus theſe of <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. are to be expounded after the ſame manner. Verily, if we might not uſe diſtinctions here, or in reſpect of what the Apoſtles ſpeak concerning Kings; then were it altogether unlawful for us to pray againſt Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle commandeth us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. to pray for them. I wonder if theſe words can be taken without all limitation and reſtriction. No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. Otherwiſe it were unlawful for us, to pray againſt Popiſh, <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi> and Paganiſh Kings. Such ſide with the Beaſt, and whom the Lord appointeth to deſtruction, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17.19. &amp; 20. In many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we read of prayers poured-out againſt ſuch. Therfore the Apoſtle's words deſerve a diſtinction, and muſt be taken in a reſtricted ſenſe. And if 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. why not alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the Apoſtle's words deſerve a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction? And ſo it is no otherwiſe lawful for us to pray for them, but as it is lawful to obey them, and ſubject our necks to their yoke. There is a time when we are neceſſarily tied to obey them. This is in the time of non-ability to reſiſt. And if it be lawful then to obey them, it is lawful then to pray for them. When the People of God are brought to ſuch a condition, that they are not able to reſiſt wicked Kings, nor ſhake-off their yoke there is nothing leſt them then but prayers and tears. And what is the end of their prayers for them? It is moſt for their own good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</hi> The People of God in the time of weakneſſe and want of power, can do no more but roll their Kings over upon God, and intreat him to do with, and in their Kings, what they cannot perform. But whereas the People of God have power to reſiſt Kings, and ſhake-off their yoke, no queſtion, as it is lawful to act, ſo likewiſe to pray againſt their proceedings. And that ever with a reſervation of God's ſecret decree, for diſpoſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their perſons according to his pleaſure. And whereas he faith, <hi>Def. Reg. cap.</hi> 6. that <hi>if the power of the People be the higher power, under any kind of Government, it followeth, there is no diſtinction and difference of Governments.</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:114526:102"/>
He is not a little miſtaken. It is great want of Philoſophy that maketh him ſay ſo. The power of the people is the ground-work of the power of all Governments. The original and fountain-power is ſtill reſerved in the people. And ſo the kinds of Government, though they be different <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> yet not <hi>materially.</hi> Democracy is dilatated Ariſtocracy, and Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy dilatated Monarchy, Ariſtocracy contracted Democracy, and Monarchy contracted Ariſtocracy. Thus the three differ not <hi>eſſentially,</hi> but <hi>accidentally.</hi> Even as the hand <hi>v. g.</hi> is one, whether folded or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert. 3.</hi> Kingly Government may very lawfully be declined, that one better may be ſet-up in its room.</p>

               <p>IN removing this difficulty, there be two things in the <hi>Covenant</hi> which we muſt carefully look to. (1.) <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Intereſt.

               <p>We ſhall not need to ſtand here. It is a matter without all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and denied by none, who profeſſe Chriſt. This way there muſt be no reſcinding of our Oath though to our own hurt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 15. <hi>He that ſwareth to</hi> [<hi>his own</hi>] <hi>hurt, and changeth not,</hi> (ſtill eſpouſing Chriſt's quartel) <hi>ſhall abide in the Lord's tabernacle, and ſhall dwell in his holy bill.</hi>

                  <hi>Aſſert. 2.</hi> By no Oath or Covenant can we be abſolutely tied, to eſpouſe the King's intereſt, and preſerve Monarchy inviolably.</p>
               <p>There is very good reaſon for this. To ſtand-by and maintain Kingly power, either it is a duty ſimply neceſſary, or not. Simply neceſſary it cannot be. 1. Becauſe any Civil Government in it-ſelf is lawful. And conſequently, as they are in themſelves, we may lawfully give-up our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance to any of them. But if Monarchy were ſimply neceſſary, at no time could we lawfully by Oath bind our ſelves, to maintain any other Government: for ſo we are abſolutely and in all reſpects obliged, to maintain Monarchy and ſubmit our necks thereto. 2. The preſervation and maintenance of Monarchy is not neceſſary to ſalvation. Who will ſay, that none can be ſaved who act againſt it, and do not maintain it? What? is every Government ſinful but it? and do all ſin who oppoſe it?
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114526:102"/>
No verily. The contrary is ſhewed already. And if the preſervation of, and ſtanding by Monarchy, be not in it-ſelf ſimply neceſſary, it is great raſhneſſe and unlawfulneſſe, to enter in Oath and Covenant, abſolutely to maintain it, notwithſtanding all hazards may enſue thereupon. 'Tis to make our duty neceſſary, where it is not ſo in it-ſelf. Thus we bind the conſcience, where God bindeth not. Whereupon I demand, whether or not are we any otherwiſe obliged to ſet-to to our duty, but in anſwerableneſs thereto and as it is in it ſelf? Sure I am, none will ſay, but the Oath ſhould be ſuitable and proportionable to the duty. And if by our Oath we ſwear either to adde to, or diminiſh from our duty, then are we either ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or wanting therein. And thus we walk not the right way, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline either to the right, or the left hand. Whereupon we make our duty wil-worſhip, either freeing the conſcience where God freeth not, or bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where God bindeth not. So then, the maintenance and preſervation of Monarchy being in it-ſelf a duty not ſimply neceſſary, it muſt needs be granted, that we cannot ſwear <hi>abſolutely</hi> to maintain it, unleſſe we make our duty wil-worſhip and ſupererogatory. And that God never required at our hands. Upon this we conclude this argument:</p>
               <p>That duty, which in it-ſelf is not <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary, we cannot lawfully ſwear <hi>abſolutely</hi> to ſet-to to it:</p>
               <p>But the maintenance and preſervation of Monarchy, is a duty in it-ſelf not <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> we cannot lawfully ſwear <hi>abſolutely</hi> to ſet-to to it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is manifeſt, from the proportionableneſſe that ſhould be between the Oath, and the Duty ſworn to. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is no leſſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the proportionableneſſe that ought to be between the duty, and the object of the duty. And if that be not kept entire, then verily there is an enclining either to the right, or to the left hand. And ſo, we either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh from, or ſupererogat to our duty.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is to ſwear to an impoſſibility, to enter in Oath and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to ſtand abſolutely by Kingly Government. 'Tis a matter very ordinary and poſſible, that all power be blocked-up from thee, till thou canſt not ſo much as endeavour to maintain it, much leſſe actually ſtand in defence and preſervation thereof. I confeſſe, the People of God, even in the matter of Religion may be brought to this. But deceive not thy ſelf. The People of God cannot ſwear abſolutely, by force and might, not only to endeavour, but alſo to act for Religion. That is alſo a vain Oath, and a ſwearing to impoſſibilities. How many times have the People of God been brought ſo low, that their power hath been wholly eclipſed. They can abſolutely ſwear no more, but to employ all power. God ſhall put in their hands, in the defence and preſervation of Religion, and never alter nor change their faith, notwithſtanding they run the hazard of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, goods, lives and fortunes. Tell me, wilt thou ſay, thou art obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſwear ſo inſtanding by Monarchy? Doſt thou imagine, thou art
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114526:103"/>
neceſſarily tied, to ſtand by Monarchy, as by Religion? Thou canſt not change thy faith, nor decline it if it be true, whether before or after thou haſt ſworn to maintain it, unleſſe thou run the hazard both of ſin and condemnation. Thou canſt not embrace the contrary faith and Religion without ſin. Which draweth-on, as its inevitable conſequent, if perſevered therein, the wrath and eternal diſpleaſure of the Almighty. But, I pray thee, thinkeſt thou it damnable to ſubject thy neck to the yoke of any other Government beſide Monarchy? Are not other Governments lawful as well as it? Are not they conſubſiſtent with Religion, and the matter of ſalvation, no leſſe then it? How dareſt thou abſolutely tie thy ſelf by Oath and Covenant, to ſtand by one only kind of Government, when as thou mayeſt lawfully ſubmit thy neck, and give-up thy allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to any kind thereof? Thus thou not only overchargeſt thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but alſo expoſeſt thy ſelf needleſly to hazard. And ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this, becauſe of all Governments, Monarchy is moſt dangerous, and leaſt to be wiſhed. Art thou not of all fools the greateſt, to ſwear ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to maintain that Government which is leaſt good, though thou mayeſt obtain that, which of all Governments is the ſweeteſt? The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <hi>Exerc. con. uſurp. pow. cap.</hi> 3. miſtaketh the matter very far, while<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith, We are equally and that ſame way obliged by League and Covenant, to maintain the King's Perſon and Authority, as by it we are tied to maintain Religion. The contrary of this is already cleared.—</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I deny not, but not only Monarchy in it-ſelf is conſiſtent with Religion, but alſo <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> it is the beſt of all Governments. Yet if we ſpeak <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> and of the ordinary fruits and Conſequences of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government, the King's intereſt alwaies cometh in competition with <hi>Chriſt's</hi> intereſt. So is proved invincibly (as we ſuppoſe) already. Now wilt thou ſwear abſolutely to maintain that, which abſolutely and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſtandeth in oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his intereſt? Thus thou ſweareſt to maintain that, which ſetweth to over-turn both Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And hereby thou preſerreſt man's intereſt to God's intereſt: for ſo thou expoſeſt both Church and Commonwealth to ordinary and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable danger and hazard, in maintaining Kingly Government inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The foreſaid Authour in the place above-cited, endeavoureth to juſtle us out of this. He taketh much upon truſt, but he proveth nothing. He would have us to take it upon his word, that Monarchy is moſt conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Religion and the good of the People. We cannot take him in this as an <gap reason="foreign">

He is not aſhamed to aver againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and experience it-ſelf, That Religion was conſubſiſtent with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and defence of the laſt King's Perſon.

               <p>HAving through the Lord's more then ordinary aſſiſtance, diſcuſſed theſe five Queſtions above-written, it now remaineth to try, what ſtrength is in them, to conclude the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> to be a lawful Government, and not uſurped power. And we make it good thus: If the Comonwealth of <hi>England</hi> be an unlawful &amp; uſurped power, then either becauſe the power of the King of <hi>England,</hi> not only according to the Law of the Kingdom, but alſo of God, is abſolute. And ſo, without uſurpation he can neither be judged, nor his Kingdom taken from him by any, but by God. Or becauſe Monarchy is of all Governments the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt. And ſo cannot be altered, nor exchanged with any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſſe we go from the better to the worſe. And it is raſh madneſſe, or ſinful raſhneſſe, to exchange the beſt with the worſt. Or becauſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government is leaſt to be deſired. Or becauſe it is unlawful, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Royal Perſon, and decline the Royal Authority. Or laſtly, becauſe we are tied, not only by the Oath of Alleageance, but alſo by ſolemn League and Covenant, to maintain and preſerve Monarchy inviolably. But none of all theſe you can alleadge, to bind uſurpation upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England,</hi> as is ſhewed already. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is a lawful, and not uſurped power.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have thought it expedient to annex to the fore-going Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> a ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition concerning the ſounding and plaguing by ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And that becauſe they do relate to the overthrowing of all Kings and Kingly Powers whatſoever. Whence my purpoſe in the fore-going Treatiſe is abundantly enforced and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That I may the more conveniently give thee my thoughts in order to theſe Angels, I would have thee in the firſt place with me to remark, that the Angels ſounding are all one with the Angels plaguing. And that not only becauſe they are alike in number, but alſo one and the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are produced by them, though ſome things are enlarged in ſpeaking of them the one way, which are abbreviated the other. I do therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Angels are not diſtinguiſhed but only in order to different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and employments. And thus one and the ſame Angels both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and execute the wrath of God upon all the enemies of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and his People. And as for their proclaiming by ſounding with trumpets, ſee <hi>Joel</hi> 3. v. 9,10,11,12. Of their executing the vials of God's wrath on the enemy and the avenger, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, &amp;c. of that ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I ſhall a little glance at that which the holy Ghoſt intendeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. And to this end I divide the chapter in theſe three parts.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a preface, <hi>v.</hi> 1. The ſecond is a narration, from <hi>v.</hi> 2. to <hi>v.</hi> 18. The third is a peroration, from <hi>v.</hi> 18. to the cloſe of the Chapter. The firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> paſs in naming of it. In the ſecond there be theſe two things conſiderable (1) a party plaguing, to wit, Angels, the Miniſters and executors of God's wrath. And they be in number Seven. Secondly, a party plagued, in number Seven alſo. The firſt of which is the <hi>Earth, v.</hi> 2. Which in Scriprure in general is taken two wayes, (1) <hi>Relatively,</hi> i. e. as it is joyned with ſome other words to make up the ſenſe of it. I have nothing to do with it as it is thus taken. (2) <hi>Abſolutely.</hi> Thus it is taken
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114526:105"/>
three wayes. (1) for one of the four Elements, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. (2) As it is contradiſtinguiſhed from <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> as from many and ſundry places is evident. (3) For the aſſiſtants of the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.16. In this <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.2. the <hi>Earth</hi> cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be one of the four Elements. Senſe and Reaſon will teach us ſo much that this noiſom and grievous ſore <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.2. expounded to be hail and fire mingled with blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.7. cannot properly be called the puniſhment or plague of the Earth, one of the four Elements. It is then to be taken <hi>myſtically,</hi> for the aſſiſtants of the Church; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will rather be preſerved then plagued, in contributing their help to the Saints, (the <hi>Kenite</hi> eſcapeth when <hi>Amalek</hi> periſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th, becauſe of his kindneſs to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his coming up from <hi>Egypt</hi>) but alſo they have rather upon them the mark of the Woman then of the Beaſt. Now the <hi>Earth</hi> ſpoken of in the foreſaid place, is expounded to be men who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the image of the Beaſt, having his mark upon them, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the oppoſers, but the worſhippers thereof; and therefore muſt needs be ſuch as be in and of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which muſt fall; the vials of the wrath of God being powred forth upon her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.8. <hi>chap.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The ſecond party plagued is the <hi>Sea;</hi> which is taken in general two wayes. (1) <hi>comparatively, Iſa.</hi> 57.20. (2) <hi>abſolutely.</hi> And that theſe five or ſix wayes.

No man will underſtand the Sea ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.3. as relating either to the Sea under the Law, or to that which is navigable: for as the one was long before the out-powring of the ſecond vial, ſo the other (to ſpeak properly) is uncapable of being plagued. Moreover, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of, that the navigable Sea ſhould be turned into blood, the third part of the living creatures in it ſhould die. &amp;c. as be competent to the Sea, ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.3. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 8.8.9.

            <p>The third party plagued is the <hi>Waters,</hi> and fountains of waters, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.4. I do find waters theſe ſeveral waies taken in the Scriptures. (1) for one of the four Elements, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.6. (2) for a calm and ſpiritual ſtate, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23.2. (3) for croſtes and afflictions, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69.1, 2. (4) for the vengeance and judgment of God, <hi>Pſa</hi> 73.10. (5) for the graces and Spirit of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. and 7.38, 39. (6) for the Nations, as alſo their Head and Glory, <hi>Iſa</hi> 8.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. Moreover, fountains of waters are taken diverſly in the Scriptures, (1) for the heads &amp; ſprings of the elementary and phyſical waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. (2) for goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.16. (3) for the ſprings of ſpiritual graces, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17. Beſide, I do find the word as it is taken in the ſingular number more variouſly underſtood then as it is taken in the plural. <hi>viz.</hi> for the ſpring of phyſical waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.7. a womans fountain, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.18. poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and habitation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.28. God himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. the Law of the wiſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.14. the fear of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.27. the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12.15. ſpoken of the eye of man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1. In this place by waters muſt needs be underſtood the Nations; and by the fountains of waters, the glory of the ſame. Sure I am, no man in reaſon will ſay. That the plaguing of the elementary waters, of ſpiritual graces, ſpiritual quietneſs, afflictions and judgment, or any ſuch like thing is intended in the out-pouring of the third vial. No verily, but the ruin and deſolation of the Nations, together with the head and glory thereof. And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nations and great ones of the Earth be two main pillars by which <hi>Babylon</hi> is underpropped: for as the Whore doth ſit upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1.15. ſo the great men of the Earth bewail her deſolation, <hi>Rev</hi> 18.9, 10, 11 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.23. yea, and ſide with her as ſhe engageth againſt the Saints of the Moſt High, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19.

Which waters, and ſountains thereof, be the very deſtroyers and perſecutors of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.6. expounded to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſuch as ſide with her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.24. Behold how the Lord in overthrowing <hi>Babylon</hi> maketh its King and <hi>Lucifer</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.4. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 12.) to fall from his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114526:106"/>
throne and dignity. Whoſe fall ſeiſeth upon the Nations, and the great ones of the Earth, by which they are enbittered and enraged, making die, and made to die. And that becauſe the ruin of <hi>Babylon</hi> is attended and accompliſhed with the fall of the Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19. and overthrow of Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20, 21. the Lord of hoſts ſtaining the pride of all glory, and bringing into contempt all the honourable of the Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.9. Where upon the heathen ſhall rage, and the people imagine a vain thing, the Kings of the Earth ſhall ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together, againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2.1, 2. So that as they ſhall be enbittered, making many die, many men dying of the waters becauſe of their bitterneſs; ſo they themſelves ſhall be deſtroyed, the waters and fountains thereof turning into blood. And thus the three main props of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be quite overturned, <hi>viz.</hi> the forces of the Nations, their heads, and the Nations themſelves, the Lord overturning, overturning overturning <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it be no more, until he come whoſe right it is, the Lord giving unto his Son the Diadem and the Crown, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.26, 27. anointing him King on his holy Hill, <hi>Zion,</hi> laying the Government on his ſhoulders in the day of his Perſonal Appearance. And thus there is an overturn for every pillar of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth party plagued is the <hi>Sun, Rev.</hi> 16 8. which in Scripture is taken theſe ſeveral wayes, (1) for the phyſical and viſible Sun, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.12. (2) God himſelf, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 84.11. (3) Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. (4) by way of compariſon, it is taken for the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10.

No man in reaſon will ſay, that in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring of the fourth vial, is underſtood the plaguing of God, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (which to aver is blaſphemy) or any ſuch like thing; but the darkning the <hi>Lucifer</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the main pretended light of the antichriſtian ſtate with ſpiritual darkneſs.

            <p>The fiſth party plagued is the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10. <hi>i. e.</hi> his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authority which ſhall be ſmitten with great darkneſs, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being full thereof, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 13.2. A ſmoke riſing out of the pit, as the ſmoke of a great furnace, by which the Sun and Air are darkened at the ſounding of the fifth Angel, while-as a ſtar falleth from Heaven on the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1, 2. whence <hi>Babylon</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by violence and darkneſs, the day of the Lord upon it being a day of waſtneſs and deſolation, a day of darkneſs and gloomineſs, a day
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114526:106"/>
of clouds and thick darkneſs, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.15. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkneſs, and not light, even very dark and no brightneſs in it? <hi>Amos</hi> 5.20. And thus with a whirlwind of violence, and a cloud of darkneſs the Lord cometh up from the North, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4. to lay <hi>Babylon</hi> with all her glory in the duſt: for as by violence the powers of <hi>Babylon</hi> are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, ſo by darkneſs they are hardened in heart, contemning the truth, blaſpheming God, and not repenting of their deeds, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9, 10, 11. So that the greater violence is executed againſt them, the more obſtinate in wickedneſs they become, blaſpheming God, his People, and Intereſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, the more plagued the more hardened. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in ſome meaſure at this very hour among the enemies of <hi>Zion's</hi> Intereſt. The more to day the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are plagued, the more blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly do they reproach and are hardened in heart.</p>
            <p>The ſixth party plagued is the <hi>River Euphrates, Rev.</hi> 16.12. Concerning which there be theſe things conſiderable. (1) The up-drying of it. Which cannot be underſtood myſtically, ſeeing in no place of Scripture the word <hi>Euphrates</hi> is taken in a myſtical ſenſe. It is read twenty times only in the Scriptures, and no where is it taken <hi>myſtically,</hi> but <hi>literally,</hi> as is more then evident to any that ſhall enquire after it. We muſt needs therefore ſay that the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſhall be dried up, the Lord with his mighty wind ſhaking his hand over it, ſmiting it in the ſeven ſtreams, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men to go over it dry-ſhod, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.15. (2) The end for which it is dried-up. Which is to prepare a way for thoſe Kings that come up from the Eaſt or the riſing of the Sun, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.12. And thus there ſhall be an high way for the remnant of his people, which ſhall be left from <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> like as it was to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the day that he came up from the Land of <hi>Egypt, Iſa.</hi> 11.16 Whence the Lord ſetting his hand again the ſecond time to recover the remnant of his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and from <hi>Egypt, Iſa.</hi> 11.11. ſhall miraculouſly deliver them as he did while-as he ſet his hand the firſt time in bringing them up from <hi>Egypt</hi> by the conduct of <hi>Moſes:</hi> for as at the firſt time he dried-up the Red-ſea before them, ſo at the ſecond time of their recovery he will utterly deſtroy the tongue of the <hi>Egyptian-ſea,</hi> and dry up the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> before them, ſmiting it in its ſeven ſtreams, that they may go over it dry-ſhod. Now upon what accompt the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> are called the Kings of the Eaſt, you may reade for this, <hi>The Saints Kingdom, ſect.</hi> 7. (3) The engagement the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> come to, as they come up from the Eaſt. Then do the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits like Frogs, draw forth the Kings of the Earth with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to a day of engagement againſt the Kings of the Eaſt. The <hi>Paganiſh, Mahumetan</hi> and Antichriſtian ſpirits, Frog-like indeed, ſhall engage all the Heatheniſh and <hi>Mahumetan</hi> powers againſt the four Angels, which are bound in the great River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> prepared for a day, a month, and a year, for to ſlay the third part of men, the number of the Army of the Horſe-men being two hundred thouſand thouſand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.14, 15, 16.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114526:107"/>
And thus at this day of engagement. <hi>Babylon,</hi> the powers of the Nations, with all their Potentates and glory, ſhal be overthrown: for in that time when the Lord ſhall bring again the captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (gathering all Nations, bringing them into the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> to plead with them there, cauſing his Mighty-Ones, the Kings of the Eaſt, the hundred thouſand thouſand to come down upon them, putting in his ſicle, the harveſt being now ripe, <hi>Joel,</hi> 3.1, 2, 12, 13.) The Winepreſſe ſhall be troden without the City, till blood come out even to the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred furlongs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.20. Thus <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the Beaſt, the falſe-Prophet the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies ſhall be deſtroyed in engaging againſt him who ſitteth on the white horſe, attended with the Armies in Heaven. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39 8, 9. &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11, 12 &amp;c. (4) the time of this up-drying and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which is ſecret and unknown. It is a time and ſeaſon which the Father hath put in his own power <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts</hi> 1.7. 'Tis not for us to know the time when the Kingdom ſhall be reſtored again to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It cometh as a thier in the night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. and therefore both ſecretly and ſuddenly. Let us therefore watch, and keep our garments, leſt we walk naked, and they ſee our ſhame.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh party plagued is the <hi>Air, Rev.</hi> 16.17. Which in Scripture is taken three wayes, (1) for one of the four Elements, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. (2) as it ſignifieth that which is done in vain and to no purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.9. (3) for the power of Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. whoſe power is airy indeed, becauſe of its ſubtilty and vanity. And thus as the Lord pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth-out the vials of his wrath upon the power of the Beaſt, ſo doth he likewiſe upon the power of the Dragon; for as in the day of vengeance, in the reign of the Ancient of dayes, while-as <hi>Chriſt</hi> reigneth in power, the ſeat and power of the Beaſt is overthrown by the up-coming of the Kings of the Eaſt; ſo in the time of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Perſonal preſence and reign Satan is chained and bound a thouſand years, that he may deceive the Nations no more till the thouſand years be finiſhed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2, 3. And this is while-as a great voice cometh out of Heaven from the Throne, ſaying, <hi>it is done, Rev.</hi> 16.17. the Myſterie of God being finiſhed, and time being no longer, in the dayes of the voice of the ſeventh Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6, 7. at whoſe founding there be great voices in Heaven ſaying, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and be ſhall reign for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 11.15.</p>
            <p>In the third and laſt part of the Chapter (of which I ſhall ſpeak but a little) the holy Ghoſt recapitulateth and ſummeth-up in few words all that he hath ſpoken at length in the ſecond part of the Chapter, in order to the fall and ruin of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. to the cloſe. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. is ſpoken as to the ſhaking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by wars, and rumors of wars, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion riſing againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom, there being tumults and earth-quakes in divers places. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. is ſpoken of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114526:107"/>
dividing of <hi>Babylon</hi> (after its ſhaking) into three parts: Of the fall of the Nations, and of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s utter overthrow and deſolation, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, in laying the Nations deſolate. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. is foretold the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Forces, Power and Glory of the Nations, in bringing into contempt all the Honourable of the Earth. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. is ſpoken, as to the grievouſnes of the plagues by which <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhal be ſhaken, divided, and overturned, the Nations, their Forces, and their mighty Ones ſhall be deſtroyed, together with men's blaſpheming God, his Truth, and his People, thereupon the more plagued, being the more hardened, as at this time in ſome meaſure doth appear.</p>
